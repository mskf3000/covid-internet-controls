After half an hour, however, they had to disperse because they had not received permission from the municipal government. <br><br>Members of the group in Los Angeles have sought and received permission to stage their protest for an hour and a half tomorrow, the online news organ reported.<br><br>Meanwhile, Thammasat University alumni living in the US have been gathering signatures of fellow Thais in the US demanding the ousting of Thaksin. <br><br>Members of the alumni association said they were soliciting signatures in the US out of solidarity with current Thammasat students gathering signatures for the same purpose. <br>  <br><br>The Nation<br>4 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

With regard to registration for party-list candidates, two small parties tried but failed to complete the registration process before yesterday's deadline.<br><br>The EC rejected the list submitted by the Kasikorn Thai Party on the grounds that the composition of five aspiring candidates was lopsided, failing to represent every region of the country.<br><br>The Tantawan Party failed to complete its registration as a new party before submitting its electoral candidates.<br><br>A group of 20 Ramkhamhaeng University students petitioned the EC to extend the campaigning period from 30 to 60 days, arguing that voters had too little time to ponder their decision.<br><br><br>The Nation<br>4 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 POLITICAL TURMOIL:  Business leaders set to speak out
	 
    </h3>
    
    
    <div class="post-body">
    
      <div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>POLITICAL TURMOIL<br>Business leaders set to speak out<br><br>Trade, industry and banking bodies expected to warn against instability <br><br>Thailand's three most powerful business bodies, which have stayed on the sidelines throughout the political clash, will soon break their awkward silence.<br><br>Executives at the Board of Trade (BoT), the Thai Bankers Association (TBA) and the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) will address the situation on Monday after maintaining a wait-and-see attitude in the face of the political turbulence. <br><br>"We may issue a statement after holding a meeting," said Pornsilp Patcharintanakul, deputy secretary-general of the BoT. <br><br>Monday's meeting will come on the heels of heightened tensions following Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's speech at Sanam Luang yesterday and ahead of a planned anti-Thaksin rally on Sunday.<br><br>The clash has drawn people from all walks of life to take a stand, particularly academics and politicians. In 1992, when Thailand was plunged into a bloody conflict in May, the three bodies united to signal a need for former prime minister Suchinda Kraprayoon to quit.<br><br>Thawatchai Yongkittikul, secretary-general of the TBA, said the association had remained silent because weeks earlier it had joined a press conference with other bodies to express their concern about the political instability. <br><br>"Since then, we have not yet discussed it again as we have been busy. As businessmen, we should not make opinions about something that may affect the economy," he said.<br><br>Pornsilp said the BoT had already expressed its stance that there should be no confrontation to avoid a negative impact on the economy and trade. <br><br>"Our association focuses mainly on trade, not politics. Right now, politics has had no impact on trade or the economy. But we are concerned about the longer-term effects. Violence would only spoil Thailand's image. Right now, we are closely monitoring the situation," he said.<br><br>A source at the FTI said it would also discuss the issue on Monday.<br><br>"As stakeholders in this society, we should produce something to show a united stand by the private sector," the source said. "Given that the conflict is continuing, we should show the public what direction to take."<br><br>He urged Thai Rak Thai and the opposition to each take a step back. The opposition should join the election while TRT leader Thaksin should leave office temporarily. <br><br>That would allow for constitutional reform and then a new election could be called. "If Thaksin does not step down," the source said, "this will never end."<br><br>The Thai Chamber of Commerce, a unit under the Board of Trade, has meanwhile closely reviewed the situation, said Dusit Nontanakorn, secretary-general of the chamber. "Still, we have not yet called for a meeting as the situation so far has remained under control," he said.<br><br>Public concerns were mostly reflected through short-term investment, particularly equity investment. <br><br>Stock prices have stayed steady due to buy orders in large-cap energy and banking stocks. Trading volume fell this week as most investors stayed on the sidelines, waiting for the picture to clear.<br><br>The SET index yesterday closed at 753.39 points, up 1.56 per cent over the week.<br><br>The volume of trading yesterday was Bt13 billion, down from Bt16 billion on Thursday and Bt18 billion on Wednesday. <br><br><br>Business Reporters<br>The Nation<br>4 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

A source said the academic changed his mind after a talk with a "respected and prominent" figure. <br><br>Surapol said in his letter Thaksin should resign and ask His Majesty the King to appoint a caretaker prime minister to run the country and call a new election with a schedule that is fair to all parties.<br><br>He urged all political parties to enter into a "social contract" to ensure political reforms were made through amendments to the Constitution.<br><br>The open letter was addressed to the premier and leaders of the three main opposition parties, which are boycotting the April 2 snap election.<br><br>Senators Chirmsak Pinthong and Karoon Sai-ngam yesterday echoed calls for a royally-appointed administration during a panel discussion on "What Lies Ahead for Thai Politics", at Naresuan University.<br><br>In a related development, university administrators said before last night's rally they were worried it would inflame public sentiment, a university president said.<br><br>"Even though the government was supposed to ease tension, it chose to fan it by mobilising a crowd to outshine its opponents," Prince of Songkhla University president Prasert Chitapong said.<br><br>The government appeared to have spent a lot of money to transport rural people here for a show of support for Thaksin at Sanam Luang, Prasert said.<br><br>Thaksin should resign from his post to end social divisions, but he has snubbed his opponents by flaunting his supporters and making provocative comments.<br><br>Leaders from selected state universities will meet today at Chulalongkorn University to map out a common stand on how to end the political tension.<br><br>The Nation<br>4 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 Deny TRT a majority, cast empty ballots - activist
	 
    </h3>
    
    
    <div class="post-body">
    
      <div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Deny TRT a majority, cast empty ballots - activist<br><br>A leading democracy advocate called on the public to cast their ballot for no one at the upcoming election in an effort to forestall an overwhelming Thai Rak Thai majority. <br><br>Prinya Thaewanarumitkul, vice rector for student affairs at Thammasat University, said he was afraid Thai politics might degenerate into a "bandit parliament", with Thai Rak Thai securing all 500 seats in the lower House during an election boycotted by opposition parties. <br><br>He said voters could "de-legitimise" the April 2 snap election by ticking the No Vote box on the ballot, thereby pre-empting a massive Thai Rak Thai victory. <br><br>"A vote for no vote is an act of public disobedience against an illegitimate election. It will show that, for the people, candidates [contesting in the election] are unacceptable," Prinya said at a seminar on "Thailand: Post-Thaksin" or-ganised yesterday at Thammasat University.  <br><br>The scholar added that if voters overwhelmingly opted for the No Vote option, the new government - very likely another Thai Rak Thai government - would have a short life, enjoying legitimacy only so long as it took to amend the Constitution. <br><br>Prinya, a student leader during the Black May uprising in 1992, urged students to launch a "Vote for No Vote" campaign with messages on stickers, flags, posters and badges. <br><br>Senator Kraisak Choonhavan, another speaker at the seminar, said he was worried that members of the public might have become addicted to Thaksin's "quick-fix" political utilitarianism, ignoring the morality of government initiatives.  <br><br>"Many Thais appreciated the extrajudicial killings of some 3,000 people allegedly involved in the narcotic business, although the international community condemned [the campaign]," he explained. He urged Thai people to change their political attitude by giving priority to politicians demonstrating probity and integrity. He also lent his support to Prinya's "Vote for No Vote" campaign. <br><br>Economist Krirkkiart Pipat-seritham said the new government should focus on sustainable economic growth and political stability. During the Thaksin era, 59 per cent of the national wealth had become concentrated in the hands of a rich few, he said. <br><br><br>Pennapa Hongthong, <br>Subhatra Bhumiprabhas <br><br>The Nation <br>4 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 PRO-GOVERNMENT RALLY : Thaksin on warpath
	 
    </h3>
    
    
    <div class="post-body">
    
      <div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>PRO-GOVERNMENT RALLY<br>Thaksin on warpath<br><br>PM urges opposition to join election; claims he won't lead again if his party gets fewer than half the votes cast <br><br>Embattled Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra yesterday issued a war cry to his supporters and threw down the gauntlet to his opponents by pledging not to become premier if his party receives fewer votes than the number of abstentions and votes against him. <br><br>Thaksin made a last throw of the dice in front of a massive crowd of more than 200,000 people at Sanam Luang for a purported Thai Rak Thai election rally. <br><br>Facing mounting pressure for his resignation, Thaksin ruled out any lingering speculation he might quit as he becomes increasingly alienated by much of the middle-class and the intellectual community. <br><br>Buoyed by waves of rural folk who poured into Sanam Luang and spilled over into Rajdamnoen Avenue, Thaksin made no secret of his intention to turn the April 2 snap election into a semblance of a presidential election. By daring those who don't like him to mark "abstain" on their papers, Thaksin apparently is trying to legitimise the poll - by making it a virtual referendum on him. <br><br>"If my party receive less votes than the number of people abstaining combined with votes for smaller parties, I will not accept the premiership," a belligerent Thaksin told the vociferous crowd. <br><br>The challenge seemed to express concern that the opposition's boycott would encourage vast numbers of voters to follow suit, turning the election into a farce. He was also apparently worried that unless the election was generally perceived as a referendum on his leadership, the credibility of the results will be seriously questioned, thus aggravating his present political crisis. <br><br>"I beg the three opposition parties, Democrat, Chat Thai and Mahachon [which have announced a boycott of the election], to join the contest. If they really insist on a boycott, they can campaign for voters to mark 'abstention' to reject me," he said. <br><br>Voters are allowed to cast a "no vote" on their ballot card to show they do not approve of any candidate. <br><br>Thaksin said after getting elected in the snap poll, he will begin political reforms by amending Article 313 of the Constitution to allow representatives of the people to draft a new charter as occurred in 1974 after the 1973 bloodshed. <br><br>Some additional laws later would be amended, he said. The whole political reform would take about one year before a referendum to endorse the new charter and another parliament dissolution before a new election. <br><br>"By doing so, I have take two steps backward … I have scarified myself for the nation," he said. <br><br>Thaksin urged all people in conflict with him to calm down after the poll so that Thailand could celebrate with dignity the 60th anniversary of His Majesty the King's accession to the throne. <br><br>Thaksin's supporters - some of whom were said to have been paid between Bt300 and Bt500 to join the rally - came in groups led by megaphone-wielding guides like tourist groups. <br><br>Sanam Luang, which covers 118,187 square metres has the capacity to accommodate about 100,000 sitting people. <br><br>The crowd was far bigger than the anti-Thakin rally last Sunday and Monday called by the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD). <br><br>"This huge presence gets rid all of my fatigue accumulated over the past five years," Thaksin said when he took the stage at 7pm. <br><br>Suranand Vejjajiva, a minister attached to Prime Minister's Office, claimed over a million attendance before Thaksin's presence. He updated the crowd figure every half an hour. <br><br>Suriyasai Katasila, coordinator of PAD, urged the Election Commission to investigate the TRT gathering as he heard the ruling party mobilised government resources to organise the rally. <br><br>Thaksin's promises during the rally were unbelievable, he said. It was impossible that Thaksin would not take up the premiership as his party would get more votes than its smaller rivals. The election turn out would be low and only TRT members would come to vote, he said. <br><br>Thaksin, moreover, has no legitimacy to champion political reform, Suriyasai added. <br><br>Key members of TRT attacked the opposition over the election boycott saying it was undemocratic and urged the supporters at Sanam Luang to vote. <br><br>Thaksin urged people throughout the nation to send postcards to Government House to show their support for democracy and the Constitution. <br><br>"Send postcards to say we want democracy. No need to love me or vote for me," Thaksin said, adding 5.3 million cards had arrived at Government House so far. <br><br>Thaksin defended the Shin Corp deal saying his family played by the rules over tax exemption. He said they still needed to pay income tax of at least Bt300 million a year. <br><br>Supporters, including thousands of motorbike taxi drivers, shouted motto: "We love Thaksin, we choose Thaksin", countering the "Thaksin get out" cry at the PAD rally. <br><br>The ruling Thai Rak Thai party tried to copy every aspect of the anti-Thaksin rally, setting the stage on the opposite side with a blue screen. Unlike the PAD on Sunday, the press was allowed to access the back of the stage without restriction and no pre-registration was required. <br><br>Suranand claimed the media was free to report on crowd numbers without fear of harassment from Thaksin supporters as anti-Thaksin protestors did with iTV last Sunday. <br><br>Students who claimed they represented 50 educational institutes took the stage to hail Thaksin. Some said the government was the best and Thaksin was their hero. <br><br>However, many students unions, including the Student Federation of Thailand, Thammasat University Student Union and high school students from Triam Udom are seeking to oust Thaksin. <br><br>Thaksin said the protest against him was the product of a conflict among his old friends. <br><br>He begged the friends-turned-foe, such as media tycoon Sondhi Limthongkul and Dharma Army chief Chamlong Srimuang, to talk to him. <br><br><br>Somroutai Sapsomboon <br>upalak Ganjanakhundee <br><br><br>The Nation <br>4 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Troops to be held back barring emergency<br><br>There will be no Army troop movements even in the event of a disturbance stemming from the two mass rallies over the weekend unless a state of emergency is declared, deputy Army spokesman Colonel Thanathip Sawangsaeng said yesterday. <br><br>"The measures possibly needed to subsequently restore peace and order will be adopted from light to intense, and [will be carried out] without lethal weapons," Thanathip said. He said any troops involved in crowd control would be armed with batons and shields. <br><br>He was speaking after the monthly meeting of commanders of the Army's combat units, including the Bangkok-based 2nd Cavalry Division and the Infantry Air Defence Division. <br><br>"The Army will only monitor the situation closely throughout the weekend period," he said. "Only normal security measures will be adopted within the compounds of the Bangkok-based units." <br><br>A source said Army commander General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, who chaired the meeting, had repeated his order that all Army personnel remain neutral in the current political situation. The meeting also discussed what to do if the situation turned violent, in particular if pro-and anti-government forces confronted each other. <br><br>Sonthi also dismissed rumours that he had asked Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to resign or was planning to stage a coup. <br><br>The source said Sonthi had asked the officers to maintain their attention to the persistent problem of violence in the South - and also in some border areas in the North following an intelligence report that drug smugglers were sneaking in and out. <br><br>Thanathip said the Infantry Air Defence Division was still in charge of security inside the Army Head-quarters compound while members of the Special Operations Command served only as a personal security detail. <br><br>He also said that a total of 300,000 stickers brandishing the slogan "We Love the King" above the Army insignia had been produced and distributed among Army units to encourage neutrality towards the political turmoil.<br><br><br>The Nation<br>4 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>One-horse race gets underway<br><br>TRT 'plans to take power for six months'<br><br>POST REPORTERS<br><br><br>Academics yesterday questioned Thai Rak Thai's use of political reform as an election platform, saying caretaker Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the party leader, lacked the legitimacy to spearhead such changes. <br><br>The academics raised the question as the ruling party prepared for a rally today at Sanam Luang, as it kicks off its campaign for the April 2 snap election widely seen as a one-party contest. Mr Thaksin is expected to speak early in the evening. <br><br>''Mr Thaksin has lost his legitimacy and lacks ethics. So the election on April 2 will be just a laundering process. The one who lacks ethics and legitimacy cannot right any wrong,'' said Assoc Prof Somkiart Tangmano of the web-based learning forum Midnight University. <br><br>Sombat Thamrongthanyawong, dean of the faculty of public administration at the National Institute of Development Administration (Nida), said 1,500 university lecturers had signed up for Mr Thaksin's resignation because they thought he lacked legitimacy to lead the country. However, he not only refused to resign but had dissolved the lower house, thus complicating matters. <br><br>Democrat party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva, who is due to address rallies in Hat Yai and Satun today, said the party was right to boycott the election. The boycott would ''expose'' the Thaksin regime, and make people decide for themselves what the system was worth, he said. <br><br>Mr Thaksin denounced the move, contrasting the boycott by the Democrat, Chart Thai and Mahachon parties with that of Aung San Suu Kyi, the icon of the pro-democracy opposition in Burma. <br><br><br>While Mrs Suu Kyi had been obstructed in her efforts to get elected and take office, ''some political leaders in our country don't want elections. I think they have to consult with Aung San Suu Kyi.'' <br><br>In a stinging reply, Chuan Leekpai, Democrat party adviser and former prime minister, advised Mr Thaksin to consult the late Adolf Hitler. <br><br>''Since he has suggested consultations with Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, I would suggest that he consult Hitler some time in the future, in the late morning or afternoon.'' <br><br>Prommin Lertsuridej, the prime ministry's secretary, said Mr Thaksin will focus on political reform, notably constitutional amendments, during the rally at Sanam Luang. <br><br>A TRT source said the party would return to power as an interim government for about six months to amend the constitution and organise celebrations of His Majesty the King's 60th anniversary on the throne. After that, the House would be dissolved and power ''returned to the people'' once more, the source added. <br><br>The prime minister would also use the rally to talk about government achievements, and address accusations on several issues, the source said. <br><br>TRT expects a turnout of about 200,000 supporters from provinces close to Bangkok. For its supporters in remote provinces, TRT is preparing to beam live telecasts. <br><br>Mr Sombat said Mr Thaksin was trying to mobilise supporters to counter his opponents, thereby widening rifts in society. ''The longer Mr Thaksin is prime minister, the wider the rift,'' he said. <br><br>At the National Health Foundation in Chatuchak yesterday, senior doctors showed up to call on the prime minister to step down and take a break from politics. ''Resignation and a pause from politics does not mean a defeat [for Mr Thaksin] ... or victory for the other side. We would see it as a mark of courage and sacrifice by the prime minister,'' said Banlu Siripanich, former permanent secretary for public health. <br><br>Dr Banlu's group included national researcher Dr Aree Walayasevi, former public health permanent secretaries Dr Pairote Ningsanont and Dr Mongkol na Songkhla. <br><br>A group of senators called on Senate Speaker Suchon Chaleekrua to call a meeting of seven former prime ministers to discuss solutions to the crisis. <br><br>Bangkok Post<br>3 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>POLITICS / RIVALS' TUG OF WAR INTENSIFIES<br><br>TRT looks poised to cruise to victory<br><br>Only 5 parties show up to register candidates<br><br>TUL PINKAEW &amp; PIYARACH CHONGCHAROEN<br><br><br>Caretaker Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's Thai Rak Thai party looks poised to cruise to success in the April 2 election. Lesser-known political parties were present at yesterday's registration for party list candidates, and even their supporters were cheering for the ruling party. <br><br>With the opposition coalition of the Democrat, Chart Thai and Mahachon parties deciding to boycott the election, only five parties including Thai Rak Thai showed up to register their party list candidates for the election, and draw the numbers which will be used to represent them on the ballot. <br><br>Shouts of ''Be courageous. You're the best, Thaksin, and we were not hired to come because we truly love him'' were echoed throughout the area surrounding Nimitbutr stadium, where the registration took place. <br><br>Streamers and balloons also flew the party's logo high in the sky. <br><br>The registration for party list candidates ends today. Registration for candidates running in constituencies runs from tomorrow until Wednesday. <br><br>Even followers of the other four small parties, who could be recognised by their small banners with their party's initials written on them, also waved the Thai Rak Thai flag with the name of Bangkok MP Wattana Saengpairor on it. They also chanted the Thai Rak Thai theme song and held up Mr Thaksin's picture in support. <br><br>''We also like Mr Thaksin and we want to support him too, and there's nothing wrong with that,'' said a Kaset-trakorn Thai [Thai Farmers] party supporter. <br><br>The four other parties present were Kaset-trakorn Thai, Prachakorn Thai, Palang Prachachon and Pandin Thai. <br><br>Mr Thaksin drew the number two slot on the ballot and to show his delight he gave a two-fingered 'V for Victory' salute to the crowd as a sign that he was ready to fight on. <br><br>After the event, Thai Rak Thai MP Sutham Saengpratoom helped escort Palang Prachachon party supporters who were holding banners saying ''We are ready to become the opposition'' out of the stadium. <br><br>Meanwhile, a television camera crew member's mobile phone went off, with the ring tone ''Thaksin Get Out'' in media mogul Sondhi Limthongkul's voice, during an interview with Thai Rak Thai deputy leader Sudarat Keyuraphan. She turned and said to the crew member: ''Don't you have any other ring tones or do you want me to help you find one?'' <br><br>Outside Bangkok, in provinces like Kanchanaburi, a little known party also prepared to field candidates in the contest. <br><br>The Kanchanaburi-based Puen Kasetthai party will field only constituency candidates in Kanchanaburi and other provinces. Its leader, Itthipol Sukkham, anticipated that the party would gain only one place in the 500-seat lower house. <br><br>The party claims to have about 20,000 members nationwide, with half that number living in Kanchanaburi. <br><br>Its head office at Ban Thasao village in Muang district reportedly bears no resemblance to a formal-looking political party headquarters. With a fence around it, the office has a signboard showing the party's name at the entrance. It consists of two-storey houses, one of which is made of wood, covering four to five rai of land on the bank of a river. <br><br>Since its inception, the party has been recruiting new members and holding meetings to educate its members on political affairs, Mr Itthipol said. <br><br>Bangkok Post<br>3 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>EC warns Thaksin against electioneering<br><br>Secretary General of the Election Commission Ekachai Warunprapa cautioned Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to be careful when delivering his speech at Sanam Luang this evening, as it might violate the election rules and regulations. <br><br>Pol Maj-Gen Ekachai stated that the Campaign for Popular Democracy has made a proposal to the Administrative Court, asking the court to halt the general election on April 2nd. He said the Administrative Court will take the matter into consideration, while his commission will follow the Election Act. <br><br>He said there is no need for the Election Commission to warn the premier over his acts in the grand speech this evening since he is an experienced person. However, he disclosed that the Election Commission will send the officials to observe the situation. <br><br>Mr Thaksin denied rumours that he would resign during his Sanam Luang address. He said there are too many rumours around, and asked reporters to help to filter the news and not to publicise unreliable reports.<br><br>He said he plans to clarify issues concerning the parliamentary dissolution, and his plan to amend the constitution within 180 days after the general election. <br><br>Government media predicted a large crowd to hear the premier, both to cheer and boo him. <br><br>Radio Thailand said:<br><br>According to a survey in Sanam Luang, there are both people who agree and disagree with the Thai Rak Thai Party's movement in regard to the general election. The opposing people give the reason that the election would waste the national budget. However, most people view that this evening's address will allow them to obtain more political details.<br><br>Bangkok Post<br>3 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 Thai democracy at another cross-road
	 
    </h3>
    
    
    <div class="post-body">
    
      <div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Thai democracy at another cross-road<br><br>By Peter Janssen, dpa <br><br>Bangkok (dpa) - On the face of it, Thailand's current political showdown makes no sense. <br><br>On the one hand you have an elected prime minister, whose party last year won an overwhelming mandate from the Thai people, being pressured by self-proclaimed champions of democracy to resign and pave the way for an appointed government. <br><br>On the other, you have Thailand's oldest political party, the Democrat Party - former overthrowers of military dictatorships and die-hard proponents of the democratic process - leading a boycott of the upcoming April 2 snap election. <br><br>What could be more democratic than a general election? <br><br>Abhisit Vejjajiva, the young leader of the 60-year-old Democrat Party, has been hard-pressed to explain why his party and two other opposition parties - Chat Thai and Mahachon - have decided to boycott a snap election called by Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra on February 24 when the premier also dissolved parliament. <br><br>Thaksin's decision to seek a fresh mandate from the people was in response to mass demonstrations against his premiership that have gained widespread support, at least in Bangkok, since his family's sale of the clan-owned Shin Corp to Temasek Holdings, an investment arm of the Singapore government. <br><br>The January 23 Shin Corp sale outraged many Thais because the 1.9 billion dollar transaction was finessed in such a way as to be tax free and because it amounted to handing over several sensitive industries in telecommunications, aviation and media to a foreign entity. <br><br>Another anti-Thaksin protest, organized by the so-called People's Alliance for Democracy, is scheduled for March 5, aiming at forcing him to resign to allow Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej to appoint a new premier and caretaker government. <br><br>While the opposition parties have vowed to stay away from the Sunday rally, by boycotting the April 2 polls they have effectively allied themselves to people power and renounced parliamentary procedure. <br><br>Asked at a recent press conference whether he wanted to go down in history as the Democrat Party leader who supported Philippines' style democracy in Thailand, Abhisit responded, "The reason some people are taking to the streets is because they have no where else to turn to." <br><br>Abhisit blames the current crisis on one man - Thaksin. "Was the problem in the Philippines under (President Ferdinand) Marcos, or the problem now in Thailand under Thaksin, the fault of the people in the streets or the fault of Marcos and Thaksin?" he asked rhetorically. <br><br>Those are strange statements from a good parliamentarian, but Thailand's democratic system has arguably entered a strange phase after five years of Thaksin rule. <br><br>Thaksin, a former police officer turned billionaire businessman turned prime minister, has brought two new factors to Thailand's political scene, namely his immense personal wealth and his populist policies that have secured him a huge electoral mandate from Thailand's rural and urban poor. <br><br>Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) Party, campaigning on a host of populist promises to deliver cheap health care, debt-write-offs for farmers and village development funds, won the January 2001 general election with the highest majority in parliament in Thai history. <br><br>In the February 2005 polls, after delivering on many of the promises made four years earlier, the TRT won 377 out of 500 contested seats, allowing them to form Thailand's first single-party government in Thai history. <br><br>With his people's mandate and personal wealth, one thing Thaksin achieved in his first term was the undermining of nearly all the checks and balances put in place by Thailand's very liberal 1997 constitution to counter the growing power it granted elected politicians. <br><br>The 1997 constitution was written in the aftermath of Thailand's last political crisis of May 1992, when street demonstrations in Bangkok led to the toppling of the premiership of Army General Suchinda Kraprayoon and the curtailment of the military's involvement in politics. <br><br>The new constitution, aimed at bolstering elected politicians over appointed military men, failed to foresee the rise of Thaksin. <br><br>"Thaksin has a very limited view of democracy," said Sunai Pasuk, Thailand representative for Human Rights Watch. "For him it is only about electoral victory, which he thinks gives him a mandate to do everything. <br><br>"Thaksin has caused so much damage to the democratic process in Thailand, to the principles, the institutions, to the point that when he came back to power last year for his second term there were no checks and balances left," said Sunai. <br><br>Thailand's lack of constraints on their populist premier was last demonstrated on February 16 when the Constitutional Court rejected a petition by 27 Thai Senators to investigate Thaksin for shady dealings in his family sale of Shin Corp. <br><br>Had the court accepted the case the Thai people may not have turned out on the streets. <br><br>"The usual ways don't work," said Sulak Sivalak, renowned social critic and one of the people who will join the anti-Thaksin protests on Sunday. "Parliament is controlled by one man and he controls almost everything so we will use people power to force him out." <br><br>A step backwards for the democratic process? "A step backwards in order to step forward," said Sulak. "Why not?"<br><br>Bangkok Post<br>3 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 Top brass lunch with PM: Supreme Commander says it's 'decision time'
	 
    </h3>
    
    
    <div class="post-body">
    
      <div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Top brass lunch with PM<br><br>Supreme Commander says it's 'decision time'<br><br>WASSANA NANUAM<br><br>Dissolution of the Lower House is not a solution to the current problems facing the country and it is now time for the prime minister to make a decision to end the political crisis, Supreme Commander Gen Ruangroj Mahasaranont was quoted as telling Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra during a lunch meeting at Government House yesterday. <br><br>A source said Gen Ruangroj's remarks represented his analysis of the current political situation. Gen Ruangroj was accompanied by army chief Gen Sonthi Boonyaratglin, navy chief Adm Sathiraphan Keyanont, air force chief ACM Chalit Phukphasuk and national police chief Pol Gen Kowit Wattana. Nobody suggested Mr Thaksin resign, the source said. <br><br>Gen Sonthi suggested the only way the situation could improve is if the two sides in conflict stepped back. However, the source said Mr Thaksin seemed determined to persist with the polls on April 2. <br><br>The source said Mr Thaksin called the swift and unexpected meeting with top brass as he was uncertain as to the stances held by Gen Sonthi, Adm Sathiraphan, ACM Chalit and Pol Gen Kowit, who were all students of Class 6 of the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School. <br><br>The sense of uncertainty came about following a personal meeting between Gen Sonthi and Gen Pallop Pinmanee, deputy director of the Internal Security Operations Command and a classmate of Maj-Gen Chamlong Srimuang, a leader of the anti-Thaksin protest, in Class 7 of the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy. It was rumoured that Gen Pallop had asked Gen Sonthi to side with the anti-Thaksin movement. <br><br>Gen Sonthi, however, said afterwards that Mr Thaksin did not mention the planned March 5 rally but expressed concern over soldiers' welfare. ''The prime minister did not ask about coup rumours. He probably knows we are career soldiers,'' he said. ''I can assure you that soldiers will not interfere in politics or stage a coup. I want to make it clear that our stance is neutral,'' said Gen Sonthi, who had been rumoured to have been asked to lead a coup to bring down Mr Thaksin. He said it was normal for those in conflict to spread rumours to confuse and damage one another, including the rumours regarding a coup. <br><br>''I don't see why I would have to do so. I don't believe anyone would dare do it. I can assure you that we soldiers are disciplined,'' Gen Sonthi said. <br><br>Gen Sonthi also ruled out the possibility that officers who were classmates of Mr Thaksin in Class 10 of the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School would come to the aid of the prime minister. <br><br>Another source, who was a member of the pre-cadet school's Class 10, said judging from conversations with his former fellow classmates the officers were split into three distinctive groups. However, he declined to identify them. <br><br>The source said that officers in the first group insisted on standing by the prime minister not only because they were his friends but also because they had received good support from the prime minister throughout his five years in office. <br><br>Those in the second group were undecided. But if Mr Thaksin was to blame for the country's problems, they would stand by the people. The third group could be described as believing that: ''In the end, we must perform the duties of soldiers under His Majesty the King.'' <br><br>Gen Sonthi admitted he invited some officers from Class 10 who commanded armed force units for talks on Monday night. He played down speculation that Class 10 officers were preparing to come to Mr Thaksin's aid, including commanders of the 1st Army Division and 2nd Cavalry Division. He said that those who chose to do so stood to be ''losers''. <br><br>Another source from Class 10 said Lt-Gen Pornchai Kranlert, assistant army chief and a Class 10 leader, and other officers commanding army units in Bangkok, set up a task force headquarters to monitor the situation on Sunday night at the Anti-Aircraft Artillery Division's officers' club at Kiak Kai intersection, under the jurisdiction of Maj-Gen Ruangsak Thongdee, the division commander. Gen Sonthi heard about it and became suspicious, so he told AAA Division soldiers to withdraw from army headquarters on Monday, replacing them with a company of Special Warfare Command soldiers. <br><br>Bangkok Post<br>1 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 Thaksin to face a bigger rally

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Thaksin to face a bigger rally<br><br>AMPA SANTIMATANEDOL<br>Anti-Thaksin demonstrators, including followers of the Dharma Army, have dispersed but vowed to come back and hold a much bigger rally on Sunday against Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Monks and around 1,000 followers of the Santi Asoke, a highly disciplined Buddhist sect which only takes vegetarian food, packed their bags and returned home yesterday morning after the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) announced the March 5 deadline for Mr Thaksin to resign. <br><br>The deadline was timely as rally-goers felt there were enough reasons to justify drawing a line for Mr Thaksin, said Chamlong Srimuang. <br><br>Maj-Gen Chamlong, former Phalang Dharma party leader, insisted that the rally participants dispersed yesterday to refresh themselves. It did not result from a conflict within the PAD, but everyone agreed that the demonstrators needed a break after staying overnight at Sanam Luang, where toilet facilities were insufficient, he said. <br><br>''The rally was a success with our non-violent approach and the criticism we directed against the government,'' said Santi Asoke leader Samana Photirak, who also joined the rally. <br><br>No entertainment or talk shows will be staged at the rally next Sunday as all demonstrators were expected to move from Sanam Luang to another place, Maj-Gen Chamlong said but did not elaborate. <br><br>Maj-Gen Chamlong, Mr Thaksin's mentor, said he had consulted with media mogul Sondhi Limthongkul on a plan to cancel the ASTV broadcast of the demonstration on Sunday in a bid to entice more people to gather at Sanam Luang. <br><br>Mr Sondhi, who kicked off the popular campaign against Thaksin, is the founder of the Manager Group, which operates the China-based ASTV station. <br><br>Bangkok Post<br>1 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 Thammasat's satirists hit another high note with revival of cycle of scorn

      <div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Thammasat's satirists hit another high note with revival of cycle of scorn <br><br><br>The rally at Sanam Luang last Sunday saw the revival of political satire through Thammasat University's famed Chinese Opera and lam tat, a Thai-style chant.<br><br>Both shows, which relied on poetic wit and word play, delighted the audience by mocking Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his cronies in an outrageous, yet tasteful, way. <br><br>They helped keep the mood of the protestors in check after a long day of cheering and jeering.<br><br>The last time such a show was staged was 15 years ago, during the May tragedy in 1992.<br><br>"The Thammasat Chinese opera troupe has generally showed up only in crisis. The last time was Black May, 15 years ago," said troupe leader and coach Viroj Tangvanich.<br><br>Thai politics has been going through a cycle - with each one taking 15-20 years. <br><br>Before the May tragedy, Thailand experienced the October 14, 1973 pro-democracy student movement, which triggered the downfall of the Thanom-Pramas military regime. <br><br>On Sunday, Thammasat's Chinese Opera caused a sensation when it began at 11pm.<br><br>It featured a special episode - "Thaksin of Siam versus Pao Boon Jin" - referring to the ancient judge from Kaiphong whose verdicts were celebrated for the absolute honesty and integrity in which justice and equality were upheld. <br><br>The troupe's members comprised alumni and students. <br><br>Many of the 30 members are famous businesspeople from the fields of printing, service and entertainment.<br><br>The thick make-up they wore helped save them from being recognised. <br><br>Viroj, who is also an alumnus, noted that the performance 15 years ago was about a bad gunman. This time it was about a bad capitalist. <br><br>"A person holding capital can do as much harm as one holding a gun," he said. <br><br>Viroj said the troupe was assembled swiftly. Invitations were sent out via e-mail. They had only half a day to rehearse. <br><br>The Chinese opera was called "Justice Pao struggles with the Square Face".<br><br>Thaksin was depicted as a greedy ruler who tried to buy everything in sight, including the court of Justice Pao. <br><br>The script's had to be rewritten because the first draft was made before the House dissolution. The writer, who prefers to remain anonymous, said he aimed to mock the government with a light and easy-to-understand approach. <br><br>Thammasat's Thai-style antiphon - in which two choruses alternate the chanting of a verse -won equal admiration. <br><br>Snoh Thienthong, who defected from the Thai Rak Thai Party and blasted Thaksin on Monday night, was awe-struck. <br><br>The performance marked a special gathering of members of the university's antiphon-singing club, which has been around for more than 20 years. <br><br>The lead singer, whose stage name is Dome Tha-Prachan, said they usually assemble during political turbulence, such as October 1973 uprising and Black May when they won critical acclaim. <br><br>"We have made a comeback this time by squeezing into some of the 'Muang Thai Weekly Programmes' hosted by Sondhi Limthongkul. Since then, more members have started to join," Dome said.<br><br>The five lam tat performers included a civil servant, a lawyer and a reporter. The lam tat lampooned politics. <br><br>The script was written two weeks before the show, but revised a bit after the sudden House dissolution, Dome said.<br><br>Besides the Chinese Opera and lam tat, entertainment also featured poetry readings by several bards, including national artist Naowarat Pongphaiboon and Seawrite winner Komtuan Kantanoo.<br><br>Chatrarat Kaewmorakot<br>The Nation <br>1 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 Thaksin dissolves his last claim to credibility
	 
    </h3>
    
    
    <div class="post-body">
    
      <div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>SIDELINES<br>Thaksin dissolves his last claim to credibility<br><br>It was another desperate wriggle out of a tight spot for an embattled Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra when he decided to dissolve the House of Representatives for a snap general election on April 2. <br><br>Certainly he needs a break from the intolerable pressure born from the widespread public outrage against his corruption-ridden government.<br><br>This follows his repeated insistence that he would not dissolve the House or resign to accommodate the demands of a broad-based, pro-democracy movement made up of many different groups and representing people from all walks of life.<br><br>The House dissolution, which is regarded as a tricky strategy to buy more time, is expected to fire up the determination of the movement seeking to evict him from office. He will be the target of severe verbal attacks during the rally scheduled for this afternoon at Sanam Luang.<br><br>The movement foresaw that Thaksin would opt for this game plan in order to take some of the fizz out of the rally. Leaders issued a statement saying that only Thaksin's resignation was acceptable, and denouncing his decision to dissolve the House as a devious trick to gain the upper hand in the polls. <br><br>"I will not dissolve the House, for it would be a betrayal of those 19 million people who voted for me." It proves again that Thaksin cannot be seriously taken as a man of his word. The boast was eventually revealed as just another falsehood.<br><br>Thaksin did not look perturbed in the least by the public's perception that he can never be expected to be sincere and honest in his statements. The House dissolution was clearly a betrayal of the public in order to allow him to save his own neck.<br><br>Appearing on TV and radio programmes to explain the decision, he was the same old Thaksin who blamed everyone but himself for the political troubles he and his family had endured all these months due to allegations of big-time corruption and other misdeeds.<br><br>It is truly unfortunate that Thailand must bear with a national leader who frequently goes back on his word without blinking an eye. He proves that people stand ready to believe bigger and bolder lies as long as these falsehoods are presented with audacity and shamelessness.<br><br>During the past two months, Thaksin has used this kind of erratic behaviour to survive growing political adversity and threats to his premiership due to his corroding credibility and public image. The sale of Shin Corp stocks, owned by his family members, has enabled the public to see his true colours and dispel all illusions.<br><br>Thaksin has become a politician with a businessman's instinct for survival. As part of the effort, he resorted to selling his business empire together with concession rights for TV broadcasting, a mobile phone network and four satellites to a Singapore government-owned fund.<br><br>The promise to come clean and tell us all about the Shin Corp deal during a special joint session of Parliament proposed for next week served as a temporary diversion. It will never happen now that the House was dissolved. <br><br>The Shin Corp deal enabled the people to comprehend the true definition and reality of how a man can betray his motherland. <br><br>At least Thaksin must feel his self-inflicted predicament to the degree that his friends have become his enemies. The last to do so was a mentor and former patron, Maj-General Chamlong Srimuang, who has now joined the movement to oust him.<br><br>The passionate plea for public understanding on Friday night and yesterday morning was aimed at rural grassroots voters who can expect a flood of cash from now until the election. In the same pitch he sought sympathy and support, fingering the pro-democracy movement as the main cause for all of his misfortunes. <br><br>Once behind a microphone, Thaksin has always been excellent with his snake-oil salesman's talent for the soft sale. The spin, although superb, was only effective in inspiring more public wrath against him. <br><br>Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai Party will likely win the general election, but not by as big a margin as last time, if it takes place at all. From now on, the anti-Thaksin movements will pile more pressure on him to leave politics, and the country, for good.<br><br>It depends on how long the movement can keep up the momentum and fan the fire of public opposition to Thaksin, especially in the provinces. <br><br>Whether he wins or loses, Thaksin appears ruined as far as his credibility and public image are concerned after going back on his word a countless number of times. He will never be regarded as a national leader who can be trusted for his integrity and honesty after the Shin Corp deal and previous corruption scandals.<br><br>With a heated election campaign in the offing, people can expect more sugar-coated lies from power-hungry, self-serving politicians who prey on naive and gullible voters, as they fight for spots in the House and opportunities to enrich themselves from ill-gotten gains and taxpayers' money.<br><br>Sopon Onkgara <br>The Nation<br>27 Feb 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 THAI TALK: Resolve crisis by removing root cause - Thaksin
	 
    </h3>
    
    
    <div class="post-body">
    
      <div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>THAI TALK:<br>Resolve crisis by removing root cause - Thaksin<br><br>The current political crisis isn't all that complicated - and the "deadlock" isn't all that hard to resolve. <br><br>This isn't about a conflict between the government and the legislative branch. Neither is it about a confrontation between the government and the opposition.<br><br>The crux of the issue is Thaksin Shinawatra. It's about the end of his legitimacy as the country's prime minister. It's about his blatant violation of political ethics. It's about how he has failed miserably in managing social conflicts. The last thread of trust between the governor and the governed has snapped.<br><br>Thaksin claims he dissolved the House of Representatives and called a snap election on April 2 to "return the power to the people." The truth is more frightening. He simply wanted to silence the growing number of people calling for his ouster and to come back for another four-year term.<br><br>Thaksin has become "the country's No 1 problem" because he would do anything to stay in power even if it means that in the process he will tear the nation apart. He has wrapped himself in a cocoon of delusion, arguing that 19 million people had voted for him in the last election and acting under the misguided notion that winning an election gives you the blanket right to commit any political crime and ignore any dissident opinion.<br><br>Thaksin's most serious political mistake was to confuse legality with legitimacy - putting self-interest above moral judgement. His legitimacy was lost forever when he ignored the ethical aspect of his family's sale of Shin Corp's shares to Singapore's Temasaek, defending the controversial sell-off of the country's major satellite and television stations only on legal grounds.<br><br>Even when every tax-paying citizen was questioning the dubious technicalities used to avoid paying a single baht of tax of the Bt73 billion deal, Thaksin was still out there provoking public anger with his deadpanned: "But I have done nothing wrong, legally anyway."<br><br>When the crowd calling for his ouster grew louder, instead of facing the challenge head-on, Thaksin dragged the whole country into a political quagmire by dissolving the House of Representatives, calling a snap election that will put him back in a more powerful position in the hope that he can use this electoral mandate to stop any call for his impeachment or for embarking on genuine political reform. This despite the fact that there was no real conflict between the executive and the legislative branches, usually the only legitimate reason to "return the power to the people."<br><br>Thaksin has become the country's real problem because with his latest political act, he has put the nation in a precarious position. He has forced people to go back to the polling booths, not to choose between his policies and those of the opposition - but to force the voters to make a very bizarre choice: Between him and what he arbitrarily labels "mob rule" - painting himself as the good, devoted politician being bothered by what he portrays as a group of law-breaking citizens, who happen to include some of the country's most respected academics, opinion-leaders, independent law-makers, a large segment of the middle-class, local community leaders, disgruntled teachers, members of the non-government organisations (NGOs) and the critical media.<br><br>Thaksin has become the country's biggest political liability because he no longer can claim the right to lead the nation's political reform despite his desperate attempt to exploit "political reform" to legitimise his further consolidation of power.<br><br>With the opposition parties boycotting the snap election, <br><br>Thaksin is effectively isolated. The country has been plunged into a state of confusion that threatens to get worse if he stubbornly clings on to power.<br><br>When all is said and done, it's not the system that's the issue. It's not even the constitution that has caused the current political turmoil. It's Thaksin manipulating the system and exploiting the constitution that is the only cause of the ongoing political "impasse."<br><br>It wasn't that long ago that people were asking: "If not him, who?"<br><br>Now, the question on everybody's lips, it seems, is: "If he stays, everybody else will go down the drain."<br><br>The time has come for Thaksin to realise that he will serve the country best when he stops serving.<br><br>Suthichai Yoon<br>The Nation <br>2 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Thai students in France call on Thaksin to step down<br><br>Somruek Chantara-amporn, a Thai student activist in France, said Thai students in France believe that Thaksin has lost his legitimacy and therefore should resign immediately from his post as the country's prime minister. <br><br>"We are calling on Thaksin to resign immediately and put an end his political career," Somruek said. <br><br>Thaksin had failed to show that he understand and has faith in democracy system. He has committed many acts that are deemed constructive to democratic values and system," the letter said. <br><br>It said Thaksin has consistently brush off just about all forms of criticism against him and employed improper tactics against his critics <br><br>The letter also questioned the sell off of Shin Corp to Tamasek of Singapore and accused Thaksin of abusing his position as the prime minister in order to avoid paying taxes. <br><br>The letter said Thaksin was a successful businessman but failed as the country's political leader. <br><br>The students said House dissolution does not constituted a responsible on the part of the premier. The letter was signed by 15 Thai students in Grenoble, Paris and Bordeux. <br><br>Meanwhile an on-line petition at www.petition49.org has attracted 306 signatures of Thai students overseas including in Europe, the United States, Australia and Japan. <br><br>The petition that is due to submit to Thai newspapers today is a campaign to oust Thaksin. The petition said Thaksin's decision to dissolve Parliament will not solve the political crisis and refers to numerous incidences of alleged corruption and wrongdoing by Thaksin.<br><br>The Nation<br>1 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>SNAP ELECTION<br>Thaksin to promise charter amendments, another House dissolution at Friday rally<br><br>Caretaker Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra will announce on Friday that the new House would spend 180 days to amend the Constitution after which another snap election will be held. <br><br>A high-ranking source from the Thai Rak Thai Party said Thaksin would make the announcement during the rally at Sanam Luang which the Thai Rak Thai would hold to show of support for the embattled prime minister.<br><br>"The prime minister will make it as a pre-poll promise to have the Constitution amended within 180 days after the election," the source said.<br><br>"Then, he will dissolve the House and call a snap election under the rules of the amended Constitution. The announcement will be a social contract."<br><br>The source said the Thai Rak Thai expected to have about 200,000 to 300,000 people, mostly from provinces, rally at Sanam Luang in support of the prime minister.<br><br>Each Thai Rak Thai former MP was asked to lead about 5,000 to 20,000 constituents to the rally, the source said.<br><br>Thaksin yesterday remained defiant against the growing call for nearly all walks of life for him to resign.<br><br>"The rumours that I've quit were not true. Actually, I've left office since the day I dissolved the House. But I will have to be caretaker prime minister until the election is done and a new government is formed," Thaksin said.<br><br>Thaksin told reporters at Government House at 1:40 pm that he would submit the Thai Rak Thai list of 100 party-list candidates to the EC at 8 am on Thursday.<br><br>Thaksin has earlier announced he would be candidate No 1 on the Thai Rak Thai party-list.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Democrat Party announced on Wedenesday that it had cancelled its plan to hold a mass rally at the Royal Plaza on Saturday in order to avoid inflaming political tensions.<br><br>"The prevailing political situation is very volatile and the Democrat rally, if held, might be exploited to serve the government," said party spokesman Ong-art Klampaiboon.<br><br>The Democrats had scheduled the rally to explain their decision to boycott the snap election before the Thai Rak Thai Party said this week it would hold a rally tomorrow at Sanam Luang.<br><br>The People's Alliance for Democracy also plans to repeat its Sanam Luang rally on Sunday.<br><br>Ong-art said the close timing of opposing rallies might result in unforeseen events, which the government might use to its advantage.<br><br>The Nation<br>1 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>BUSINESS SENTIMENT<br>Political concerns scare off investors<br><br>Political strife is having an impact on investor sentiment as private investment and consumption slowed in January, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) said yesterday.<br><br>Suchada Kirakul, the central bank's senior director, said political uncertainty was influencing decisions by investors to bring in funds, especially for the government's planned mega-projects.<br><br>According to the bank's January study, the country's political woes had shaken the confidence of investors as many sat on the sidelines, waiting to get a clearer picture of what the future holds for Thailand.<br><br>The Business Sentiment Index (BSI) in January stood at 45.2, compared with 45.4 in December. That was the index's first fall in four months.<br><br>A separate index of expectations for the next quarter stood at 53.2, compared with 53.4 in the fourth quarter of last year.<br><br>The central bank refused to forecast how economic growth would be affected by the situation.<br><br>It also did not want to comment on the Finance Ministry's forecast, which said growth would slow by half a point because of the protests.<br><br>"We have to wait and see how the situation affects the economy," Suchada said.<br><br>As the conflict had been drawn out over the months, the private sector appeared to have factored in some of the side-effects, she said.<br><br>Suchada believes manufacturing sectors that had no political affiliation should continue to perform well.<br><br>But the BOT warned that a delay in mega-projects would affect expected investment inflows.<br><br>The bank sees investment growing to Bt135 billion this year against the government's target of Bt250 billion.<br><br>A change in government would also delay 2007 budget disbursement by five to six 6 months, she said.<br><br>Suchada said government investment accounted for 7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).<br><br>As private consumption depended on incomes, she suspected spending patterns would not change too much as employment levels remain constant.<br><br>The BOT forecasts total investment will grow 10.5- 11.5 per cent this year. Private investment should rise about 9.5-10.5 per cent.<br><br>Private consumption was expected to hover around 4-5 per cent.<br><br>Asked what the impact would be if there was a coup, Suchada noted that the economy in 1992, the time of the last popular uprising, the economy grew 8 per cent, slightly below the previous year's level of 8.6 per-cent.<br><br>Anoma Srisukkasem<br>The Nation<br>1 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 STOPPAGE: Hello and goodbye from Democracy scorned
	 
    </h3>
    
    
    <div class="post-body">
    
      <div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>STOPPAGE<br>Hello and goodbye from Democracy scorned<br><br><br>Dear Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra: <br><br>I am not sure whether this is supposed to be a greeting or a farewell. It could be both, though, because while we've never talked before, I may not have a chance to write again. No, I'm not going anywhere, but you might be. Politics is funny, huh? Although you may not be laughing, for obvious reasons.<br><br>I was tempted to write a long time ago, when you made that world-renowned statement about me in December 2003. "Democracy is not my goal," you said. In your opinion, one "can't drive a Rolls-Royce to a rural village and fix people's problems", and there are times when "a pickup or good off-road vehicle will do". I was said to be just a "tool", something that was "good and beautiful" but which should not be the nation's ultimate aspiration.<br><br>Great speech! But here's my take: you don't miss the water until the well runs dry. It seems the Sanam Luang crowd and the opposition bloc don't want to use a Rolls-Royce at the moment, either.<br><br>I must confess that the election boycott hurts me like hell, but let me tell you a little secret: I've gone through this kind of "surgery" before, in other countries with leaders like you.<br><br>I'm not one to harbour a grudge. In fact, I'm the most accommodating and forgiving of the lot. Check out my counterparts like Fascism or Communism or even Socialism. Yes, you might have flourished with some of them, but when it comes to downfall, you would never find a place for a soft landing. My point, however, is that the leader of a socialist or communist country could be hanged if he insulted his nation's overriding ideology the same way you did.<br><br>I'm not boasting that I'm the best. But it pains me to be insulted by people like you, those who are given opportunities that are hard to come by in other countries, to climb from rags to riches. I had to fight back tears every time you invoked those "19 million votes" to defend your actions, knowing full well that deep in your heart, you never really appreciated my real merits and principles. Without me, your assets-concealment scandal would not have gone through the National Counter Corruption Commission, where they allowed you to defend yourself, and then the Constitution Court, where you again could defend yourself. Without me, you could have easily ended up in a summary investigation like the one launched against the Chatichai administration in 1991.<br><br>To be fair to you, I'm different things to different people. Leaders who shared your belief that I'm just a "tool", not an inspiration, have often used me as a stepping stone. Once they got what they want, they forgot all about me. They all have one thing in common though: whenever their backs were against the wall, they called for me.<br><br>I'm fed up with those losers, you know. The pattern is all too familiar. They order drug suspects or alleged militants shot in the morning, force news outlets to sack editors in the afternoon, buy off those employed in checks and balances in the evening and come to me with flowers when they have nowhere to go. They don't really know me or my essence. I'm only their springboard and last resort, nothing else.<br><br>So, don't be surprised if I act like a woman scorned from time to time. Before asking what's wrong with Thailand's "democracy", following the announced election boycott and considerable public support for it, ask yourself these questions: do you recognise the rights of the Sanam Luang demonstrators to air their disappointment with you? Do you think it's justified for your Shin Corp to sue someone for hundreds of millions of baht for simply questioning its alleged profits from government decisions? Do you honestly think it's right for the government to help provinces that supported your political party first? And when members of the public criticise you, are they "stupid", or are they just performing their duty as Thai citizens?<br><br>If you think you can break the rules, then so can I. And don't worry about me, because I can take care of myself. You can go on and complain about anything you like, but please don't pretend this is the end of me. I exist in places where they cherish and foster my real values and spirit.<br><br>You said on Monday that you had done your best. Well, sorry, my friend, your best wasn't good enough.<br><br>Goodbye from someone you never really knew, <br>Democracy<br><br><br>Tulsathit Taptim<br>The Nation<br>1 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 Non-violence is not simply the absence of physical violence
	 
    </h3>
    
    
    <div class="post-body">
    
      <div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Non-violence is not simply the absence of physical violence<br><br>Many, but especially the organisers of this past Sunday's anti-Thaksin rally at Sanam Luang, are fond of referring to the campaign to oust Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra as a "peaceful" and "non-violent" way of demonstrating their frustration with the premier, who is widely perceived to be self-serving and corrupt. But is this true?<br><br>The principle of non-violence covers both physical and verbal actions.<br><br>Strongly worded criticism of Thaksin and his family is understandable, but the outright vulgarities demonising him at Sanam Luang could not possibly be termed "non-violent expression".<br><br>Campaign tools, too - T-shirts, banners, stickers, badges - that were distributed containing hateful and foul language against Thaksin; could these be considered non-violent?<br><br>Sanam Luang on Sunday was not the site of a peaceful campaign, as the organisers would have had the public believe. Contrary to its stated mission, representatives of the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) themselves seemed to enjoy using verbal violence to stir up hatred.<br><br>For example, social critic Sulak Sivaraksa on stage compared Thaksin to a dog that protesters should pity. Speaker Auychai Watha went too far with his show of extremely bad taste. "Whoever cheated [the country], may their children become whores infected with venereal disease!" exclaimed Auychai, who is chairman of a northeastern teachers' group.<br><br>On the ground, a group of protesters harassed an iTV journalist reporting from the scene. Was that peaceful expression?<br><br>And that was not the first time for journalists to be heckled or threatened with physical harm at an anti-Thaksin demonstration. With the exception of media tycoon Sondhi Limthongkul's ASTV, the protesters were repeatedly told that virtually all other electronic media were enemies bent on distorting the news in favour of the Thaksin government. Television networks might be pro-government, but describing working journalists as enemies is far-fetched and simply paranoid.<br><br>Many still recall the hate speeches separating "us" and "them" that were the precursor to the violence between right-wing pro-government militiamen and student activists. The students were brutally hunted down and slaughtered in large numbers in the 1976 bloodbath in that very same Sanam Luang and adjacent Thammasat University.<br><br>The non-violent movement has been around in Thailand for a long time, but Thai society still seems unfamiliar with the concept. It is shameful that we have failed to learn non-violent discourse with which to interact with others.<br><br>The harassment of the iTV news crew is a case in point. Peace advocates and organisers should do more than simply say "sorry". The PAD, as one of the organisers of the demonstration, cannot avoid its responsibility by blaming it on rogue elements bent on discrediting the movement, as it tried to do. Unfortunately, the "Manual for Peaceful Demonstration", hundreds of which had been distributed by Phra Phaisal Visalo and his Buddhika Buddhist Network, went ignored by the emotional demonstrators.<br><br>"The Buddhika Buddhist Network set up a booth [on Sunday at Sanam Luang] because we saw a problem," said Phra Phaisal, founder of the Religions for Society Group in 1973, Thailand's first organisation for the promotion of non-violent approaches. At Sunday's demonstration, the network unveiled "Ethics first" as its motto to promote a peaceful demonstration.<br><br>The manual listed 10 approaches for peaceful demonstration, including treating everyone politely, even those holding opposite viewpoints. Obviously, not many protesters or organisers - certainly not the speakers up on stage - read the manual, judging by the speakers and the harassment of the iTV crew.<br><br>Amnesty International (Thailand) chairwoman Somsri Hananantasuk seems to have been among the few who did read it. She sent an e-mail to PAD members.<br><br>"It would be great if demonstration leaders tried to control the speakers' language on stage. The way we've condemned Thaksin and his family has been rather rude. Aueychai Watha words about prostitutes [in regard to Thaksin's daughter] was not proper," she wrote.<br><br>"Sulak did not have to compare Thaksin to a dog, and the moderator [Suvit Watnu] should have called for the demonstrators to respect the rights of the iTV reporters, as well as of every member of the pro-Thaksin camp who came to distribute their leaflets. I was saddened to hear the speaker call for Thaksin's execution. I myself am strongly against the death penalty, and this is not funny. We do not support violence, and neither should we foster conditions that would provoke violence."<br><br>Respected peace scholar Chaiwat Satha-anan, in praising those struggling for democracy, said courage and hatred were incompatible with each other. He said the mark of non-violence was the courage to defeat fear and hatred in solving a conflict.<br><br>The peace scholar said he had followed the anti-Thaksin movement in the news and approved of some of the satire and humour used in speaking out against Thaksin and what he represented.<br><br>"A sense of humour is important and a weapon of non-violence, but inciting hatred against others is unacceptable," he said.<br><br>Hateful speech that demonises other people limits the effectiveness of a non-violent approach, and it actually sets back freedom of speech, as well.<br><br>The PAD has announced its next demonstration to oust Thaksin through what it claims is a non-violent campaign. But the organisation needs to take a deep breath and think about what "non-violence" actually means.<br><br>Subhatra Bhumiprabhas<br>The Nation<br>1 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

Opponents of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra are resolute in doing whatever it takes to oust him from office.<br><br>But the embattled Thaksin is equally determined to cling to power, whatever the cost.<br><br>The three main opposition parties - the Democrats, Chat Thai and Mahachon - have said they will boycott the snap election next month. This is seen as an act of political retaliation at Thaksin's runaway power and negative influence over many state agencies.<br><br>The public remains divided, with many urban residents disgusted about Thaksin's leadership style while many rural voters feel bound by the patronage system to follow rather than challenge a leader.<br><br>Business leaders want the political storm to blow over as soon as possible in order to ensure a robust economy, and academics have yet to reach a consensus on how the constitution needs to be amended to best suit Thai society.<br><br>Political suspense has been heightened by rumours of an imminent military coup, which, if allowed to happen, would entrench dictatorial rule in Thaksin's favour because key commanders are close to him.<br><br>Rival parties must pause, take stock of the situation and do everything in their power to resolve the stand-off.<br><br>Jointly holding the key to end the political turmoil are Thaksin and Democrat Party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva, who represents his opposition allies, Banharn Silapa-archa and Sanan Kachornprasart.<br><br>Thus far, Thaksin and Abhisit have been talking through the press. The two need to meet face-to-face and map out how to launch a new round of political reform via constitutional amendments.<br><br>At the heart of reform is the charter rewrite to break down the power concentrated in the hands of Thaksin. In order to achieve this, Abhisit has made it clear that Thaksin must remove himself from power to prevent the drafting process being contaminated.<br><br>The Thaksin-Abhisit negotiations, if they happen, could follow a number of options via charter provisions and democratic precedents.<br><br>In a worst-case scenario, the talks would break down and Thaksin would seek a fresh <br>mandate to govern in spite of the opposition's boycott. <br><br>He already has the backing of minor parties to shun the opposition alliance in the electoral process.<br><br>However, the turmoil would persist and the country would be dragged into political trauma, from which no one would emerge a winner.<br><br>But, judging from his renewed call for talks with the opposition, Thaksin realises the political perils he would face if he were to return to power by a hollow election triumph.<br><br>Under Article 7 of the Constitution, politicians are obliged to rely on democratic precedents whenever an impasse occurs without a legal solution.<br><br>After the October 1973 uprising resulted in bloodshed and unprecedented turmoil, relevant parties sought and received a prime minister bestowed by His Majesty the King.<br><br>At the time, a political vacuum was thwarted and society was able to move on.<br><br>Under the present circumstances, Thaksin and Abhisit can choose either to work things out themselves - to name a caretaker prime minister, or petition for royal intervention to wipe the political slate clean.<br><br>Should the two fail to agree on a politically neutral leader while the charter is rewritten, mediation by the president of the Privy Council may be deemed necessary.<br><br>Given a possible stalemate in the political chess game, it may be best if rival parties take a breather before resuming the game under improved rules.<br><br>Your comments are welcome.

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Move to oust PM goes international<br><br><br>The campaign to oust Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has spread abroad, with a rally in Los Angeles and the launch of an online petition for overseas students. <br><br>The petition calling for Thaksin's resignation at www.petition49.org includes signatures from Thai students in Europe, the United States, Australia and Japan.<br><br>It says the decision to dissolve Parliament will not solve the political crisis and refers to numerous incidences of alleged corruption and wrongdoing by Thaksin. <br><br>"Those who sign the petition are of the opinion that Thaksin has adopted policies that could harm the country's economy in the long term. His government's short-term policies to stimulate the economy have caused a skyrocketing of public and family debts," it says.<br><br>Thaksin's government has allowed widespread corruption among its inner circle to go unchecked, damaging the competitiveness of the private sector, it adds. The petition also condemns the House dissolution called by Thaksin on February 24, saying the problems the country faces are of Thaksin's making, not the Parliament. <br><br>As of yesterday evening, more than 200 Thai students abroad, mainly PhD students in the US and Europe, had signed the petition. <br><br>They include students at the London School of Economy, Harvard University in the US and Cambridge in the UK.<br><br>Those who set up the website set today as the deadline to sign the petition. It will be sent to a Thai newspaper tomorrow.<br><br>Meanwhile, on Sunday some 100 Thais staged a peaceful protest calling for Thaksin's resignation, in front of the Thai Consulate in Los Angeles. <br><br>They wore white T-shirts emblazoned with slogans like "Thaksin Get Out" and called themselves "The People's Alliance for Thai Democracy in the US".<br><br>The protest lasted only an hour because the group did not have official permission, a protester told ThaitownUSANews, an online newspaper for Thais in LA. <br><br>Marisa Chimprabha<br>The Nation<br>1 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>PAD to PM: Think only of resigning<br><br>Premier Thaksin Shinawatra should spend five days alone to consider his situation -then step down, a leader of the People's Alliance for Democracy said yesterday. <br><br>Suriyasai Katasila said the group's decision to have a five-day break before another rally at Sanam Luang was because the group wanted Thaksin to have time to think. <br><br>Society would also have time to consider different ideas and clear up any confusion in their minds. People would realise the origin of all problems was Thaksin, he said.<br><br>During the five-day break, the group will prepare to co-ordinate with Alliance members in the provinces, who will come to gather in Bangkok and remain demonstrating until Thaksin resigns.<br><br>Various anti-Thaksin groups have been protesting in the provinces in parallel with the big rally in Bangkok. Suriyasai said it was too late for Thaksin to see and talk with former opposition parties. He should spend the little remaining time deciding to resign. The situation was far from a dead end and was not so serious that it required a royally-appointed government.<br><br>The social contract Thai Rak Thai Party signed with minor political parties meant nothing, he said, because it was a promise based on the morality of those who signed it.<br><br>Meanwhile, a political scientist suggested that Thaksin should withdraw from politics to end the crisis over his leadership.<br><br>"The political deadlock will be resolved if Thaksin decides to remove himself from the upcoming elections," Chaiyan Chaiyaporn of Chulalongkorn University said.<br><br>The PAD would end its protest if Thaksin withdrew, he added. With or without Thaksin, the ruling Thai Rak Thai Party was likely to win a fresh mandate to form the next government, he said.<br><br>By taking the bold decision not to stand for re-election, Thaksin would win public praise.<br><br><br>Sathien Viriyapanpongsa<br>The Nation<br>1 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

    <div class="post-body">
    
      <div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Charter reform 'won't solve all problems'<br><br>A larger cross section of the public should participate in any constitutional change and in deciding what a post-Thaksin Shinawatra society should look like, social commentator Chaiwat Thirapanthu said yesterday. <br><br>"Constitutional reform is a difficult task because people have differing assumptions about it," said Chaiwat, the director of Bangkok Forum, a civic group made up of middle-class members.<br><br>"A constitution is just a rule aimed at ensuring the democratic rule of law. Democracy should not be for democracy's sake but must serve people and ensure justice, the well-being of the people, as well as ensuring human dignity. This ought to be the preamble of the constitution," he said.<br><br>But the charter was not a tool for solving every problem, Chaiwat said. This view was outdated because society has become more complex.<br><br>Vote-buying would continue to distort the country's electoral system and it could take at least five to 10 years to ensure free and fair elections, he said. <br><br>University students could play a greater role in ensuring clean elections. <br><br>He said an independent electoral court could be set up to supplement the Election Commission, which has been widely criticised for failing to be impartial.<br><br>Media independence had to be ensured, and policing and the judicial system need reform, he added. <br><br>Chaiwait said it was unlikely he would vote in the election next month because he expected it would be unfair and used to "whitewash" Thaksin. <br><br><br>Pravit Rojanaphruk<br>The Nation<br>1 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 POLITICAL CRISIS: Opposition rejects PM's poll-delay sop
	 
    </h3>
    
    
    <div class="post-body">
    
      <div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><strong>POLITICAL CRISIS<br>Opposition rejects PM's poll-delay sop<br><br></strong>Abhisit says he won't meet Thaksin, EC hints it's too late<br><br>The opposition parties yesterday spurned an olive branch offered by Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who suggested he was open to the April 2 snap election being postponed.<br><br>The premier's move came in response to the opposition's decision on Monday to boycott the polls.<br><br>The Election Commission (EC), however, remained firm on the election date. Commissioner Prinya Nakchudtree said that unless there was a good reason to delay the poll, the agency would continue with its plans for an April 2 vote. "We will have to consider whether a postponement will bring any benefit."<br><br>Earlier, at the Cabinet meeting, Thaksin instructed Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam to discuss with the EC about the possibility of delaying the election, a Government House source said.<br><br>Wissanu said afterwards that it was possible that the commission would put off the election in order to give political parties more time to prepare. He added that if the election was really postponed, it would be held by April 25, the maximum legal limit of 60 days after the House dissolution on Friday.<br><br>"If the political parties do not want to participate in the election and the date is the condition, I am willing to co-operate," the premier told reporters, in an apparent concession to his opponents.<br><br>Thaksin said an intermediary was trying to arrange a meeting between himself and opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiva, who had rejected talks with the premier.<br><br>"I am willing to meet anywhere, to go see Abhisit at his house or at the Democrat Party headquarters," Thaksin said.<br><br>Democrat leader Abhisit said he had not received any official contact from the prime minister.<br><br>"Even if we had been contacted by him, we would not change our stand," he said. "We don't know why the premier rejected our proposal [to amend the Constitution] in the beginning."<br><br>Abhisit ruled out a meeting with Thaksin, saying the PM was now revealing his true self. "He is claiming that he is ready to compromise, yet in the past he has showed he was not able to do this," he said.<br><br>Chat Thai leader Banharn Silapa-archa said his party would not change its decisionon the boycott. "Some party members told me that if I will not field candidates I should not live in Thailand. But if I field Chat Thai candidates I wouldn't be a human, but a dog," Banharn said.<br><br><br>-------------------------<br><br><br><strong>Students take EC to court<br></strong><br>The Thammasat University Student Union (TUSU) filed a complaint with the Administrative Court yesterday, accusing the Election Commission of illegally issuing an order to organise the general election on April 2.<br><br>In the complaint, the student union said the commission committed an offence last Friday by giving the go-ahead for the snap poll without gaining a quorum of four of the five commissioners. One EC commissioner was abroad and one had died earlier.<br><br>The court has accepted the complaint and will now consider whether it has the jurisdiction to hear the case.<br><br><br>The Nation<br>1 March 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>
