<li>Once you have determined that everything is correct then release the start button from the machine then it will speed up the sewing process</li>
<li>You can also setup the control slider for speeding up your machine such that you are comfortable with it</li>
<li>When you come close to the stitching then press the start/stop button then the machine will slow down so you will be getting the complete control of the machine</li>
</ul>

<p>There are lot of bags are available in the market where each one of them differ in the quality, finishing, price and the most important thing we consider is that the material in which the bag is made of.

<p><strong>Best leather for making bags</strong></p>
<p>The leather bags are seen to be the top quality bags because they are made of the leather material and it is a regular misconception and it made up of the best quality materials to contain the leather with it. There are many types of the leathers are used for making the bags and each leather differs in their quality and it is your responsibility to know the difference between the each leather and take the correct decision to buy the high quality leather bag.</p>

<li>Lambskin leather</li>
<li>Patch leather</li>
</ul>
<p>The cowhide leather is considered to be the best choice of the leather material for making the bags and when you are shopping for a new kind of the leather bag then you should look at the type of the leather in which the bag is made. When the durability of the bag is not issue but rather you choose to buy the bag which has the soft touch then the lambskin leather may be the best choice. Each leather has the different types of the grains in which they are originated they are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Top grain</li>
<li>Full grain</li>
<li>Corrected grain</li>
