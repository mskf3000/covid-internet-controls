The aid will help schools reopen and expand summer programs to help students catch up on learning. It also offers a chance to pursue programs that have long been seen as too expensive, such as intensive tutoring, mental health services and major curriculum upgrades.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“This feels like a once-in-a-generation opportunity for us to be able to make critical investments,\" said Nathan Kuder, chief financial officer of Boston Public Schools, which is expecting $275 million.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the spending decisions carry high stakes. If important needs are overlooked — or if the money does not bring tangible improvements — schools could face blowback from their communities and from politicians who influence their funding. At the same time, schools must be wary of dreaming too big and taking on long-term costs they cannot sustain.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said the assistance allows schools to “hit the reset button” and confront challenges that have long plagued the nation’s education system. He said schools can train teachers in social and emotional learning and work to close persistent racial disparities in education.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“With successful implementation, our students are going to have a better experience than they did before the pandemic,” Cardona said in an interview.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Districts with higher concentrations of poverty will get the largest sums. Public schools in some cities are expected to receive more than $1 billion, including Los Angeles and Philadelphia. The new money joins more than $67 billion made available to schools in other relief packages during the pandemic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Schools must reserve 20% for summer programs and other efforts to address learning loss, but they expect to have wide flexibility in how to use most of the aid. With more than three years to spend the new money, school leaders are thinking big.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Officials in Boston say the aid will be used to reopen, recover and “reimagine what is possible for our students,” Kuder said. The money will help update aging buildings, but it could also be used to start new dual-language programs or revamp the curriculum, he said. Ultimately, officials plan to ask residents what changes they want to see.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In Tulsa, Oklahoma, where 83% of students come from low-income families, the district expects to get $120 million — nearly three times the amount it gets in federal education funding in a typical year. Along with building upgrades, the aid will help achieve a goal to provide summer programs and after-school care in every neighborhood, officials said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We plan to use this moment to consider how we can bring about lasting change for our school district,” Superintendent Deborah Gist said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>School officials in Hartford, Connecticut, say they have lined up a list of “must-win” spending areas. Superintendent Leslie Torres-Rodriguez said the district plans to “radically expand” learning options outside the school day, cultivate a pipeline of new teachers and expand the role of schools in their communities.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The district also hopes to buy new curriculum materials across all grades and subjects, a goal that was previously out of reach. “It is something that we’ve never been able to do,” Torres-Rodriguez said. “All that we’ve been able to afford is a little bit here and a little bit there.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Even though the funding brings a bonanza for some districts, questions loom around other sources of financial support. Some states have already slashed education budgets as they face steep revenue losses, and other states are likely to follow, which could diminish the effect of the federal dollars.\u003c/p>\u003cp>To keep future costs in check, many schools are avoiding big hiring increases, and few are pursuing programs that carry heavy personnel costs. Instead, many will consider adding teachers under short-term agreements or hiring contractors to provide social and mental health services.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Virginia Beach, officials are weighing whether to add teachers under one-year contracts, with a focus on recruiting retirees or others outside the teaching profession. The district is also exploring whether to train current teachers in high-demand subjects and to add mental health services through a telehealth provider.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s a substantial increase, but it’s important to understand that these are not ongoing funds,” Superintendent Aaron Spence said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The top goal is to get students back in the classroom. In Detroit schools, which expect to receive $800 million, much of the aid will be used on ventilation systems and to pay the costs associated with smaller classes and social distancing. Some of it is expected to go toward hazard pay for teachers who return to the classroom.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And while the funding is largely intended to reverse the setbacks caused by a year of remote learning, there’s also a push to sustain virtual options. At Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland, officials are expanding summer learning, but they also plan to start a virtual academy for students with health concerns and those who thrived under remote learning.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Akron, Ohio, a large, urban district that expects to get $96 million in new aid, Chief Financial Officer Ryan Pendleton said the money offers the potential to “forever change education for the better.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It is a wonderful, wonderful opportunity from a terrible pandemic.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press writers Michael Melia in Hartford, Connecticut, and Kantele Franko in Columbus, Ohio, contributed.\u003c/p>","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":8,"shortId":"cdd7728bc85968866d9c8eca23ce5034","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/cdd7728bc85968866d9c8eca23ce5034","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"xxUpdated":"2021-04-04 23:15:33","socialEmbeds":null,"flattenedFirstWords":"With a massive infusion of federal aid coming their way, schools across the U.S. are weighing how to use the windfall to ease the harm of the pandemic — and to tackle problems that existed long...","id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:cdd7728bc85968866d9c8eca23ce5034","media":[{"altText":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","xxUpdated":"2021-04-04 18:04:44","audioMimeType":null,"id":"f7fc080711c7473a8710dd4d21a6b7e7","alignment":null,"embedCaption":null,"videoRenderedSizes":[],"imageMimeType":"image/jpeg","state":null,"etag":"f7fc080711c7473a8710dd4d21a6b7e7_1a1aza3c0","externalId":null,"videoMimeType":null,"managementId":null,"flattenedCaption":"FILE - In this March 31, 2021, file photo, freshman Hugo Bautista eats lunch separated from classmates by plastic dividers at Wyandotte County High School in Kansas City, Kan., on the first day of in-person learning.

Blackwell is a prominent Black civil rights attorney and one of the founders of the Minnesota Association of Black Lawyers. Last year, he won a \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/d2f6c6d9dbf1dc55394d8160ddcfcbaf\">posthumous pardon \u003c/a> for a Black man wrongly convicted of rape before the infamous Duluth lynchings of 1920.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"176e6b40-7c50-11eb-bc47-43519f8e4e00\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But law professors following the case said it's Blackwell's unique ability to translate complicated legal jargon into information jurors can understand that made him the obvious pick to lay out the prosecution's case.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“One of the things he’s known for is his ability to speak English rather than ‘legalese,’” said Joseph Daly, emeritus professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota. “It’s extremely important in this case just to try to explain what the elements of the crimes are that Mr. Chauvin is charged with.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIN ELDRIDGE QUESTIONED TWO OF THE YOUNGEST WITNESSES. WHY?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Eldridge joined the Minnesota attorney general’s office in 2018. Before that, she served as a special assistant U.S. attorney in Nebraska and the Northern District of Iowa.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jonathan Simon, a professor at University of California Berkeley School of Law, noted that our culture associates women with “being more caretaking toward children, toward juveniles.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Using Eldridge as the questioner may help to \"ease the witnesses' experience and get their testimony as effectively as possible, but also to help the jury see this in the most sympathetic light,” Simon said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Daly said Eldridge \"was particularly adept at showing empathy and kindness and a certain softness, which I think is really important when you’re questioning children.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>When an 18-year-old witness, Alyssa Funari, began to cry, Eldridge told her to take her time and offered a tissue.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Is this difficult for you to talk about?” Eldridge asked. “Do you need a minute?”\u003c/p>\u003cp>IS THERE A DRAWBACK TO USING SO MANY DIFFERENT PROSECUTORS?\u003c/p>\u003cp>St. Louis University School of Law professor Sue McGraugh said she sought to make a personal connection with jurors when she was a prosecutor. She said she's rarely seen a case with so many prosecutors, and that it carries some risk.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s unusual because, as someone who has tried a lot of cases, you do want the jury to form some sort of attachment to someone on the legal team,” McGraugh said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>SO, WHY SO MANY?\u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s evidence of the stakes in the trial that Daly called “possibly one of the most important cases ever in the United States and possibly the world.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz appointed Attorney General Keith Ellison to handle the prosecution just days after Floyd's death, and Ellison vowed to utilize whatever resources were necessary.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:10059966943\">Full Coverage: Death of George Floyd\u003c/div>\u003cp>Frank and Schleicher have handled the lion's share of questioning since the trial began. Frank is a 21-year veteran of the attorney general’s office and has led the criminal division for 14 years. Daly called Frank “the most experienced and skilled lawyer in the criminal division of the attorney general’s office.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Schleicher is a veteran trial attorney and prosecutor who works for the law firm Maslon LLP. He spent 13 years in the U.S. attorney’s office and was a prosecutor in the case of \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/1cbb965d61f143a08c4c224220b9be43\">Danny Heinrich\u003c/a>, who confessed in 2016 that he killed 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling in 1989, and led authorities to his body. \u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT IS THE FULL DEPTH OF THE PROSECUTION TEAM?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The prosecution team has 13 lawyers, said John Stiles, Ellison's spokesman, and a 14th acted as a jury consultant.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ellison, Frank and Eldridge are the only ones who work in the attorney general's office. The team also includes Assistant Hennepin County Attorney Joshua Larson and nine outside attorneys. Stiles said the outside attorneys are all working pro bono, or without pay.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The roster behind the scenes is deep. Perhaps the best-known player is Neal Katyal, former U.S. acting solicitor general who has argued dozens of cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. Katyal led a successful effort to get a third-degree murder charge reinstated against Chauvin after the judge initially ruled it didn't fit the circumstances.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Stiles said in an email that about half of the outside attorneys are working full-time on the case.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT ABOUT THE DEFENSE?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nelson is the lone defense attorney, aided in court by a legal assistant who is also an attorney but who hasn't taken part in the courtroom arguments. The defense is funded through the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association’s legal defense fund. Though Chauvin was fired soon after Floyd’s death, he has the right to representation through his years as a member of his local union.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nelson is an attorney with the Minneapolis firm Halberg Criminal Defense and one of 12 attorneys for the MPPOA who take turn handling officer-involved cases. While Nelson is alone in court, he can consult with the other 11 attorneys, the association said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, the in-court optics are hard to ignore.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Judge Peter Cahill has said Nelson “does not have the same level of support” as the prosecution.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Find AP’s full coverage of the death of George Floyd at: \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-george-floyd\">https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-george-floyd\u003c/a>\u003c/p>","truncatedFirstWords":true,"mediaCount":6,"shortId":"e1a14774fe5d88666232187c1413d5b8","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/e1a14774fe5d88666232187c1413d5b8","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{"minnesotaattorneygeneralsoffice":{"isPr":null,"name":"minnesota attorney general's office","canonicalName":null,"order":0},"minnesotastategovernment":{"isPr":null,"name":"minnesota state government","canonicalName":null,"order":0}},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":[{"leadHubLink":true,"displayName":"Death of George Floyd","calloutText":"Full Coverage:","isPermanentlyPlaced":true,"tag":{"isPr":false,"name":"Death of George Floyd","canonicalName":"death-of-george-floyd","id":"DeathofGeorgeFloyd"},"type":"Hub Link","id":"afs:Content:10059966943"}],"xxUpdated":"2021-04-04 23:15:33","socialEmbeds":[],"flattenedFirstWords":"Viewers watching the trial of a former Minneapolis officer charged with murder in George Floyd 's death may be struck by the array of prosecutors taking turns presenting their case.

It has elevated levels of phosphorous and nitrogen and is acidic, but not expected to be toxic, the agency says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Crews have been discharging water since the pond began leaking in March. On Friday, a significant leak that was detected escalated the response and prompted the first evacuations and a declaration of a state of emergency on Saturday. A portion of the containment wall in the reservoir shifted, leading officials to think a collapse could occur at any time.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Hopes, the county administrator, said Sunday that with new state resources, crews will be nearly doubling the amount of water being pumped out of the pond and taken to Port Manatee. Currently about 22,000 gallons of water are being discharged per minute, and Hopes said he expects the risk of collapse to decrease by Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Early Sunday, officials saw an increase of water leaking out, but Hopes says it seems to have plateaued. The water running out on its own is going to Piney Point creek and into Cockroach Bay, an aquatic preserve in the Tampa Bay north of the facility.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Looking at the water that has been removed and the somewhat stability of the current breach, I think the team is much more comfortable today than we were yesterday,\" he said. “We are not out of the critical area yet.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Hopes said he could not rule out that a full breach could destabilize the walls of the other ponds at the Piney Point site.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Florida DEP Secretary Noah Valenstein said another pond has higher levels of metals.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The radiologicals are still below surface water discharge standards.

Some algal blooms can also harm humans who come into contact with polluted waters, or eat tainted fish.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Environmental groups urged the federal government this weekend to step in to halt sending more wastewater to the existing so-called gypsum stacks and halting the creation of more phosphogypsum, which is left behind when phosphate rock is mined to produce fertilizer.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We hope the contamination is not as bad as we fear, but are preparing for significant damage to Tampa Bay and the communities that rely on this precious resource,” Justin Bloom, founder of the Sarasota-based nonprofit organization Suncoast Waterkeeper, said in a statement.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gomez Licon reported from Miami.\u003c/p>","truncatedFirstWords":true,"mediaCount":7,"shortId":"e89153cffa62c07d51ba1e3438966237","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/e89153cffa62c07d51ba1e3438966237","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{"floridastategovernment":{"isPr":null,"name":"florida state government","canonicalName":null,"order":0},"floridadepartmentofenvironmentalprotection":{"isPr":null,"name":"florida department of environmental protection","canonicalName":null,"order":0}},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":[],"xxUpdated":"2021-04-04 23:23:12","socialEmbeds":[{"isHeroImage":false,"id":"se0:6fecc8f0-7c50-11eb-be56-c5f73dcfb28e","caption":"","html":"\u003ciframe title=\"Wastewater leak prompts evacuations\" aria-label=\"chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-tMSPh\" src=\"https://interactives.ap.org/embeds/tMSPh/8/\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border:none\" height=\"569\">\u003c/iframe>\u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\u003c/script>","display":"se0","alignment":"middle"}],"flattenedFirstWords":"PALMETTO, Fla.

His family says Quinto didn't resist the Antioch, California, officers — one who pushed his knee on the back of his neck, and another who restrained his legs — and the only noise he made was when he twice cried out, “Please don’t kill me.” \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The officers replied, “We’re not going to kill you,” the family said. Police deny putting pressure on his neck. Three days later, the 30-year-old Navy veteran and Filipino immigrant died at a hospital. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It is the latest stark example of the perils of policing people with mental health issues. In response to several high-profile deaths of people with mental health issues in police custody, lawmakers in at least eight states are introducing legislation to change how law enforcement agencies respond to those in crisis. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The proposals lean heavily on additional training for officers on how to interact with people with mental health problems. It's a common response when lawmakers face widespread outcry over police brutality like the U.S. saw last year following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. But none of the proposals appear to address the root question: Should police be the ones responding when someone is mentally ill? \u003c/p>\u003cp>In California, lawmakers introduced legislation on Feb. 11 that, among other things, would require prospective officers to complete college courses that address mental health, social services and psychology, without requiring a degree. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In New York, lawmakers in January proposed an effort to require law enforcement to complete a minimum of 32 credit hours of training that would include techniques on de-escalation and interacting with people who have mental health issues. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The proposal came nearly a year after Rochester, New York, officers put a spit hood over Daniel Prude’s head and pressed his naked body against the street until he stopped breathing. The victim’s family, like Quinto's, said they had called 911 for help after Prude, who is Black, began having a mental health episode. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Similarly, in Utah, the mother of 13-year-old Linden Cameron called 911 in September because he was having a breakdown and she needed help from a crisis intervention officer. Salt Lake City police ended up shooting him multiple times as he ran away because they believed he made threats involving a weapon. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>He was hospitalized, and no weapon was found. The officers were not crisis intervention specialists but had some mental health training. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Last month, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation that will create a council to standardize training for police crisis intervention teams statewide.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At least 34 states already require officers to have training or other education on interacting with people who have physical or mental health conditions. But law enforcement experts say updated training is needed and agencies are far behind. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The training that police have received for the past I’d say 25 years has not changed significantly, and it’s out of date, and it doesn’t meet today’s realities,” said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington-based think tank. “I mean the last thing a mother wants when they call the police is for an officer to use force. Especially in a situation that didn’t call for it because the officers weren’t trained in how to recognize a crisis.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some of the new legislation looks to strengthen or improve standards. But because mental health training is a mandate in a majority of states, some advocates and experts believe it may never fully prepare officers on how to respond.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Treatment Advocacy Center, a nonprofit dedicated to getting treatment for the mentally ill, concluded in a 2015 report those with untreated mental illness are 16 times more likely to be killed during a police encounter than others. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The solution that would have the most impact on the problem is to prevent people with mental illness from encountering law enforcement in the first place,” said Elizabeth Sinclair Hancq, co-author of the report.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Since that is not always possible, she said, another solution is to create co-responder programs where a social worker or other mental health professional assists officers on such calls.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That is what Philadelphia introduced in October, weeks before officers fatally shot Walter Wallace Jr., a Black man, within a minute of arriving at his address for the third time in a day while he was having a mental health crisis. Police said Wallace ignored commands to drop a knife.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Other cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, have similar programs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For families of victims, who now say they regret calling 911 for help, required training and legislative reform are long overdue. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“In retrospect, it wasn’t the smartest idea to call the police,” said Isabella Collins, the 18-year-old sister of Quinto, who died in California. “But I just wanted him to be able to calm down, and I thought that they could help with that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Antioch police didn't release details of Quinto's death for more than a month. Police Chief Tammany Brooks has denied that officers used a knee or anything else to put pressure on Quinto’s head, neck or throat. An investigation and autopsy are underway.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The department didn't respond to a request for comment. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Quinto's family filed a wrongful-death claim against the city in February, claiming he “died as a direct consequence of the unreasonable force used against him.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I guess it was really naive of me to think that he wouldn’t get hurt,” Collins said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Amiri reported from Columbus, Ohio.

Upon ascending to the throne in 1999, Abdullah named Hamzah as crown prince, only to revoke the title five years later.

Awadallah is a former Cabinet minister and one-time head of the royal court.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Safadi said Hamzah was warned Saturday by the country's military chief to halt his activities but rejected the request.

He also claimed an individual with links to foreign intelligence services had offered services to Hamzah's wife on Saturday afternoon to try to get her out of the country.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Jordanian news site Amoon identified the individual as an Israeli named Roy Shaposhnik. In a statement to the AP, Shaposhnik identified himself as a “former Israeli” businessman living in Europe, and a close friend of Hamzah's, but denied ever being an intelligence agent. He said he offered to host Hamzah's wife and children after hearing about the prince's predicament. The offer, he said, was based on the “strong personal friendship” between their families.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Safadi declined to say whether the prince would be charged with a crime, saying only there were attempts to resolve the matter amicably.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Such public clashes between the highest ranks of the long-ruling family are unheard of, and any signs of instability in Jordan could raise concerns throughout the region.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The United States swiftly announced its “full support” for Abdullah. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait all expressed solidarity with the king. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Labib Kamhawi, a Jordanian political analyst, said the strong support for Abdullah reflected his generally good relations across the region as well as a concern that similar troubles could strike other countries.\u003c/p>\u003cp>None of the leaders in the region “would like to see havoc hitting any regime,” Kamhawi said. “It could be contagious.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. considers Jordan a major ally, granting it access to military equipment and assistance. U.S. special forces and other troops routinely train with the Jordanians. The kingdom hosts some 3,000 American troops.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Stability in Jordan and the status of the king have long been a concern throughout the region, particularly during the Trump administration, which gave unprecedented support to Israel and sought to isolate the Palestinians, including by slashing funding for Palestinian refugees.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That placed Jordan, which serves as the custodian of Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem — and is home to a large Palestinian population — in a delicate position. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Jordan made peace with Israel in 1994.

On Thursday, Buttigieg arrived at the White House for a Cabinet meeting on his two-wheeler. And that wasn't his only “regular guy” moment. Dog park devotees in the District of Columbia have also seen him there, chatting up anyone from children to members of Congress such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Buttigieg first had his eye on the job of the man who is now his boss, Biden. \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/9a141437992adacfa6dfa04c4e197b86\">Buttigieg's presidential campaign\u003c/a> was surprisingly successful — he essentially tied for first with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Iowa caucuses and finished a close second to him in the New Hampshire primary — and he made a strong impression as someone who represented the future of the Democratic Party.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Now the man known during his campaign as “Mayor Pete\" — he was the mayor of South Bend, Indiana — faces the first test of that potential in his first job in Washington: leading a Cabinet department with a $75 billion annual budget and a mandate to help spur an infrastructure program that Biden has likened to the the building of the interstate highway system in the 1950s.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He will have to navigate the complicated politics of both an entrenched bureaucracy at the Transportation Department and the fraught politics of a bitterly divided Washington. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He may have found a way by just riding a bike, which has gained fans from even skeptics in Congress. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“You've got to keep your head up,” Buttigieg told The Associated Press, explaining the path and potential dangers posed from unaccustomed drivers, but he said it can be a much quicker journey from point A to B.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Biden on Thursday tasked Buttigieg and four other Cabinet members — the “Jobs Cabinet” — with selling the administration's infrastructure and climate plan, a flood of money for roads, bridges, airports, broadband communications, water systems and electric cars.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But the plan has already hit a wall with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who objects to the corporate tax increases Biden says will pay for the plan and pledges to oppose it “every step of the way.” On the other side, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, says the package should be significantly larger.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Daunting as it may seem, the challenge of helping build consensus fits the ambition of the man who had the audacity to run for president from the perch of being mayor of a midsize town in Indiana. When Biden selected the smooth-talking Naval reserve veteran for the transportation post, he praised him as offering “a new voice with new ideas determined to move past old politics.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In an interview, Buttigieg said he believes that bipartisan consensus is attainable. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Joining Buttigieg in selling the plan are Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’ve had enough conversations, especially the one-on-one conversations away from the cameras with members from both sides of the aisle, to know there really is a sincere interest in getting this done,” Buttigieg told the AP. “Now politics can get in the way of that of course. But I think unlike a lot of other issues where there is just deep passionately felt profound disagreement about what to do, here there’s a really healthy overlap in terms of our ideas about what has to happen, even if there is a lot of difference on how to get there.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Translation? Republicans like smooth roads and fast internet for their constituents, too. But so far, there is no indication Republicans share his position.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The proposal offers big stakes for Buttigieg at the department, where he pledges to promote public transit and other green alternatives to gas-guzzling cars and apply an “equity lens” to infrastructure projects. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Black and brown neighborhoods have been disproportionately divided by highway projects or left isolated by the lack of adequate transit and transportation resources,” Buttigieg tweeted in December. Under Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, he said, \"we will make righting these wrongs an imperative.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Just two months into the job, Buttigieg has met with two dozen House members and 13 senators and in recent days has upped that pace, talking to lawmakers both parties every day.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Republicans describe the former McKinsey consultant as likable and open-minded, even if they wonder at times about his actual level of sway on legislation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis, the top Republican on a key panel overseeing highways, said he’s talked with Buttigieg twice, once at a meeting with Biden and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House. He called the conversations “really good.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m very excited to be able to work with him,” said Davis, a cyclist back home in his rural district, who thinks the former mayor can bring a valuable street-level perspective to filling potholes and easing congested streets.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If he wants to go for a ride to discuss bike lanes and public transit, I’d welcome that,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Though the youngest Cabinet member at age 39, Buttigieg possesses a star power matched by few others in the group. He's displayed an ability to command media attention and use those moments — including during a series of memorable Fox News hits around the election — to sway the public, including those not always apt to vote Democratic. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He’s spoken at the popular SXSW conference in Texas, joined Gov. Ralph Northam, D-Va., to promote expanded passenger rail, and tweets at a frequency to a wider public that comes close to rivaling Donald Trump when he was president. Buttigieg promotes transit policy both on his official and personal account, where he also expresses devotion to his husband, Chasten. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Buttigieg, who owns two dogs, has even been seen at a neighborhood park with Ocasio-Cortez. A chance meeting, he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The new transportation secretary had one recent stumble: He had to quickly walk back a plan to charge drivers per mile they drove. It's a proposal that has some support among Republicans but could violate Biden's campaign pledge not to raise taxes on people earning less than $400,000. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Buttigieg has impressed West Wing aides with his work ethic and willingness to learn, and he was quickly granted approval to pursue a robust engagement with the media. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The president’s advisers also hold warm feelings toward the former mayor for his decision last spring to quickly endorse Biden after abandoning his own campaign, helping accelerate the end of the Democratic primary contest. And Biden has compared Buttigieg to his late son Beau, a powerful evocation that helped cement his importance to the president. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Now bound to Biden’s agenda and performance, Buttigieg begins a phase likely to enhance his public service portfolio — and life experience.\u003c/p>\u003cp>This phase accomplishes what some allies have said Buttigieg needed, a next chapter, beyond the underdog story of the boy wonder from the small Midwestern city. Friends and advisers had long suggested that he get out of South Bend and see more of the world than his seven-month deployment to Afghanistan in 2014 allowed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Buttigieg was also busy taking steps toward running for president when he got married in June 2018 and when his father died six months later. During the campaign, he said he and Chasten had hopes of becoming parents.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Asked about his desire to be a father, Buttigieg told the AP “we’re still working at that,” before adding with a smile, “Stay tuned.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>As quickly as he rose, Buttigieg swiftly suspended his campaign in March 2020, before Biden's ascension in the primary was clear. He knew when to get out. He'll probably know when to get back in, too, if he does.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He has incredible political talent and skill,” said Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, a longtime friend and 2020 campaign supporter. “But part of that talent and skill is having really great political timing.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>On that front, she sees his work on infrastructure not as \"part of this grand plan on his next move,” but rather as a demonstration of his ability to focus on the task at hand.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Buttigieg and his husband have been spotted walking around their new neighborhood, Capitol Hill, where they live in a one-bedroom apartment, meandering the artisanal stalls at Eastern Market to smiles from residents.

(AP) — Now comes the hard part for Gonzaga. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Less than 16 hours after walking off the floor with one of the most scintillating wins in the game's history, the barely-still-undefeated Bulldogs returned to the practice court Sunday to get ready for the national championship game. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Their opponent, Baylor, is rested, ready and waiting for a challenge. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The meeting Monday is one most hoops fans have waited for all year — two years, really — a matchup between two teams who have been on a collision course since the bracket came out.\u003c/p>\u003cp>No need for extra motivation here. But how do the Zags move on after THAT? \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“It's a lot in 30 hours, but it is what it is,” Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. “My guys have been great at game preparations all season, so consistent with effort and the attention to detail on game night. So, we're definitely banking on that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>To recap, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/sports-gonzaga-bulldogs-mens-basketball-larry-bird-jalen-suggs-mens-college-basketball-4d529cdaf1e2934447fe70353b324e55\">Jalen Suggs banked in a shot\u003c/a> from a step inside the midcourt line at the buzzer to lift the Zags to a 93-90 overtime victory over UCLA. The game ended after 11 p.m. Saturday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>By the time that happened, Baylor (27-2) was back at the hotel. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We were probably like everyone else on the eighth floor of the hotel,” Baylor coach Scott Drew said of the reaction to The Shot. “Pandemonium erupted.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Bears rolled over Houston 78-59 and, suddenly, they look every bit as unbeatable as the unbeaten Bulldogs (31-0). No team has come closer than nine points of Baylor over the three weeks in Indianapolis. \u003c/p>\u003cp>GAMES LOST\u003c/p>\u003cp>This matchup has been a long time in the making. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Had the COVID-19 pandemic not washed out the 2020 postseason, both these teams would have been No. 1 seeds in last season's NCAA Tournament. \u003c/p>\u003cp>They were supposed to play this season, too. The meeting was set for Dec. 5 in Indianapolis — a Final Four preview in the Final Four city, many predicted — but the game got scratched when a Zags player and a staffer tested positive. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The coaches worked hard to try to reschedule. But there was no room on the calendar. Instead, they meet for the title. \u003c/p>\u003cp>This marks the first time since 2005 that the top two teams on the overall seeding list have faced in the final. Gonzaga has spent the entire season at No. 1 in the AP poll. Baylor spent 15 of 17 weeks at No. 2 and finished at No. 3 (behind Illinois).\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>MO'S MOMENT\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nobody will ever forget Adam Morrison's tears against UCLA. Now, nobody will forget his “Yeessssss.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The former Gonzaga star was crestfallen, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlS1_WWTr-Y\">weeping with his head buried\u003c/a> in the hardwood after a devastating loss to the Bruins in the Sweet 16 back in 2006.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Fifteen years, later, he does color for Bulldogs radio, and his \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/briannnnf/status/1378553798411628545?s=20\">reaction to Suggs' game-winner\u003c/a> was getting plenty of buzz a day later. It's three loud shouts of “Yesssss” with some other hooting and hollering to wrap it up. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Few said the team's sports information director played it for him on the way over to do his interviews Sunday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“A pretty special moment, and I was happy for him and proud of him for letting his guard down,\" the coach said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>PRIOR TO THE PAUSE\u003c/p>\u003cp>Before COVID put a three-week hold on their season in February, the Bears were undefeated, too. \u003c/p>\u003cp>After starting 18-0, they lost two of six shortly after coming out of the break. Drew said the lack of quality practice time during the layoff, then afterward when Baylor was playing almost every other day, took its toll on the team's defense. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Only when the Bears lost to Oklahoma State in the Big 12 tournament semifinals were they able to get back to practicing regularly, and get back to basics. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Our players really bought in,” Drew said. “Our defense was lapsing, and we had to get back to where we were.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Analytics rank the Bears third in the nation in forced turnovers and sixth in steals — part of the formula for stopping Gonzaga’s top-ranked offense. \u003c/p>\u003cp>PRIME MATCHUP\u003c/p>\u003cp>Baylor's Davion Mitchell's nickname is “Off Night,” because anyone he D's up on seems to have one. His next task: Stopping Suggs. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In addition to making the shot of the tournament, Suggs is averaging 14 points and 5.5 rebounds a game and setting himself up as an NBA lottery pick should he decide to leave.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Mitchell says he knows he can't shut down anyone completely. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“My job is just to slow ‘em down, not to keep ’em from scoring,” Mitchell said. “Everyone's really good at this game. My job is just to limit that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>UNDEFEATED\u003c/p>\u003cp>Few and Drew are fishing buddies in the offseason, and pickleball partners in the basketball bubble. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Conceding that it might be a break in COVID-19 protocols, Few said he and the Baylor coach haven't lost a game on the pickleball courts set up at the baseball stadium where teams have gone for fresh air during their semi-quarantined stay in Indianapolis.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The coaches' time together during the tournament has offered them a chance to reflect on their journeys. Few has been head coach at Gonzaga since 1999 and helped build the tiny school into a powerhouse. Drew took over a Baylor program \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/houston-houston-cougars-mens-basketball-kelvin-sampson-scott-drew-indiana-d5551a3ea55dd9b61c4943d50d5e0137\"> eviscerated after the 2003 murder of player Patrick Dennehy\u003c/a> by a teammate.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We've talked about where we were and where we are,” Few said. “Our path was a lot smoother and didn't come from a dark place.

Brothers","relatedStoryEmbeds":null,"storyHTML":"\u003cp>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The only reason Baylor's backcourt can't be considered a true brotherhood is the blood coursing through their veins.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Whether they were declaring together for the NBA draft or withdrawing from it, transferring from other schools or helping newcomers acclimate to coach Scott Drew's program, Jared Butler, MaCio Teague and Davion Mitchell have done just about everything together over the past couple of years.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That includes leading the Bears to their first national championship game since the 1940s.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But that much-anticipated showdown with unbeaten Gonzaga on Monday night, the only team that kept the Bears from ascending to No. 1 all season, probably wouldn't have been happened had those three not returned to Baylor this season.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Teague was the first to declare for the NBA draft last spring, shortly after the Big 12 and NCAA tournaments were called off due to the coronavirus outbreak. Butler dropped his name in the hat after an All-American season a couple weeks later, and Mitchell might have done the same if scouts cared as much about defense as they do offense.\u003c/p>\u003cp>All three came back, though. Each had their own reasons, but one in particular tied them together: The trio knew that they would have a chance to win the program's first national championship.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I don't think the COVID ending was, like, a big reason why everybody came back,” Butler said, “but I think we all explored our options equally and we wanted to see where we were at in our basketball career. And we just made the decision to come back, and we felt like, each one of us felt like coming back was the best option.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>It certainly was the best situation for Baylor.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Along with Mark Vital, who decided around the same time to return for his fifth season, the Bears wound up bringing back just about their entire lineup from a team that spent time at No. 1 last season. And if not for a the pandemic putting a stop to everything, the Bears could have been chasing their Final Four dreams 12 months ago.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I remember when it got canceled,” Butler said, “it was like a tornado hitting our town in Waco, Texas, and just destroying everything. It was like, ‘What?’ It was so crazy. We just couldn't understand it. We couldn't fathom it.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>It's still hard to fathom, especially when the Bears looked into the stands on Saturday night. Mixed among the thousands of cardboard cutouts in the lower section of Lucas Oil Stadium, and behind the masks required for fans to attend, were three members of last year's team cheering them on against Houston in the Final Four. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Devonte Bandoo and Freddie Gillespie had graduated, and Tristan Clark had retired from basketball due to injuries, the pandemic having short-changed all of them of a once-in-a-lifetime March Madness experience.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We did talk to our team before we went out and said that Freddie and Devonte and Tristan were all in the stands and how much they wish they had this opportunity but they’re here to cheer us on,” Drew said Saturday night, after the Bears had cruised to a 78-59 victory over Houston. \"And moments like that make you reflect and think you feel so bad for the guys that didn’t have that opportunity and never will, but at the same time you feel so blessed and fortunate these guys are this year.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Teague, who began his career at UNC-Asheville before becoming one of the nation's best 3-point shooters with the Bears, was the first player to declare for the draft and the first to opt out. Butler, who had been projected as a mid-second round pick, decided just days before the pushed-back August deadline to return to school.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Except for Drew, perhaps, nobody was happier to hear it than Mitchell, the third of the Three Musketeers. The transfer from Auburn was just starting to flourish, and now would have his buddies to help him go to the next level.\u003c/p>\u003cp>All three earned All-American votes this season: Butler a first-team pick, Mitchell a third and Teague honorable mention.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If you let Davion tell it,” Teague said with a smile, “he's going to say he's the reason I came to Baylor. But on a serious note, he did text me and say that if I came here, he felt we could make it to a Final Four. And we've done that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>That was three years ago. Teague and Mitchell both sat out redshirt seasons while the Bears were starting to build toward what they would eventually become, and when they became eligible, they quickly ascended to No. 1 in the nation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Now, more than a year after that point — after a pandemic curtailed the end of last season, toying with the NBA draft, and coming back to take Baylor on a ride unlike any other — they have a chance to finish the season on top.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This is it. This is us. This is what we do — this is what we came to Baylor to do,” Butler said, thinking back to a midseason win over Oklahoma. “I think at that point, I thought, ‘Wow, we’ve got some guys. We've got some real winners in the room,' and I think at that moment, I felt like, ‘We can make it to the Final Four and the national championship game.’\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>More AP college basketball: http://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"truncatedFirstWords":false,"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"BKC--National Championship-Baylor's Brothers","headline":"Baylor trio of Butler, Teague, Mitchell headed to title game","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:7563437f50cdb70245a3e116284cd100","signals":["newscontent"],"etag":"7563437f50cdb70245a3e116284cd100_0a1aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":null,"latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By DAVE SKRETTA","revision":null,"mediumIds":["d41b8c4c0a854766a556f8487c8921b1","ea93efb41ef34e4bb74dc7b2212c2ecc","5f9f7fa477bc4abf96bbe41fc72ba962","3da446c6fa074212b303c6ec195e67fd","69cb66e368d1433cb64f51793e81c2bb","7b95790010bc484db6e0e59554c811f5"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/d41b8c4c0a854766a556f8487c8921b1/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"Houston guard DeJon Jarreau (3) drives around Baylor guard Davion Mitchell (45) and guard Jared Butler (12) during the first half of a men's Final Four NCAA college basketball tournament semifinal game, Saturday, April 3, 2021, at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.

Some officials in Britain and the United States are exploring if proof of immunization could help large-scale gatherings to return, though there remains significant resistance to such measures in the U.S. Whether a shot is necessary to go back to work or class is an even thornier question. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"ce315690-7c50-11eb-8be9-6153f07b158e\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In many countries, the decisions may raise the prospect of further dividing populations along the lines of wealth and vaccine access.

Many parts of the world have received few, if any, vaccines.\u003c/p>\u003cp>So far, Israel has relied primarily on a series of incentives meant to encourage people to get a vaccine. It has established a “green pass” for the fully vaccinated whose holders can attend concerts, dine out, go to the gym or travel to popular vacation spots in places like Egypt, Cyprus and Greece. Those who do not have the pass are out of luck.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The system has worked well in areas of leisure and entertainment.

Those who continue to refuse can perhaps be given different jobs, work remotely or undergo frequent testing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Davidovitch, a former military epidemiologist, has experience with the issue.

The Biden administration, which has eased some of Trump's hardline immigration policies and is facing an uptick in migration, has recently added two more — Myanmar and Venezuela.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>While temporary, the program can be renewed by U.S. officials and has been repeatedly. If supporters and critics agree on anything, it's that a temporary program should not last decades. \u003c/p>\u003cp>More than half of those with the status are from El Salvador, which was designated for the program after a 2001 earthquake. Many Salvadorans who initially qualified for TPS had fled their country after a civil war and have set down roots in communities from California to Arkansas. Most have no plan of returning to a country that still sees thousands leave each year in search of economic stability and safety from gangs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Giving these immigrants the ability to stay could drive many of them to buy homes and invest in businesses in U.S. communities still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, said Manuel Orozco, director of the Center for Migration and Economic Stabilization at the development organization Creative Associates International. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s almost like the logical thing to do because they are de facto Americans,” Orozco said. “It definitely will create better conditions for them not only to integrate but also strengthen their economic roots, improving the economy.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:10033043086\">Full Coverage: Immigration\u003c/div>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>On the outskirts of El Salvador's second-largest city, Santa Ana, Iris Franco runs a bakery at home and delivers the bread on a bike. It's how she makes ends meet for herself and her four children, the oldest of whom is studying to be a doctor — the first in her family to attend college.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Already that's a change from how she grew up. Neither she nor her older sister, Chavez, finished high school. They both worked as kids while their mother, who lived in a house made from adobe, sold tamales to scrape by.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In 1994, the family reluctantly agreed Chavez would travel north with smugglers to stay with relatives in Los Angeles and work for three years. She would save up money and come back.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It didn't happen quite as they planned. Chavez got married and had children. But the money she vowed to send always arrived — first, in small bits, then more once she started getting better-paying restaurant and retail jobs under TPS.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Franco, 41, said the family lives humbly but is in a better place thanks to her sister's help. Her mother's home is modest, but more stable, and when Franco's home was destroyed in a flood, Chavez's contributions helped her rebuild. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Chavez sends money to help cover their mother's diabetes medication and food, which is out of reach for their mother, who earns $6 a day in the family bread business.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It changed our life, because we knew that we had my sister in that place, and so in whatever she could, she has helped us,” Franco said. “She has always paid attention to us.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Central American country of 6.5 million people has long relied on migrants \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/san-salvador-coronavirus-pandemic-el-salvador-1623416c0ddc7aa238911f8a422b6c8b\">sending money home\u003c/a> to help power its economy, totaling nearly $6 billion last year. Since people with the temporary status often hold higher-paying jobs than those without legal papers, they're sometimes able to contribute more to their families, said Jesse Acevedo, a University of Denver political science professor who researches international migration. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Not that migration hasn't come at a price. Franco remembers her sister crying when their mother was ill and she couldn't be there and on the many Mother's Days she missed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But now the technology is better, so the sisters can swap text messages daily and speak several times a week. They finally saw each other four years ago when Chavez filed paperwork with the U.S. government to travel to El Salvador. She surprised her mother, Elsa Victorina Franco, at the airport, met her nephews and nieces and agreed to send what she could to help the oldest train to become a doctor. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Chavez was afraid that she wouldn't be allowed back in the United States when she flew back after her trip. Such cases are up to U.S. border officials; but they let her in.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“When we went to drop her off, she told me, ‘Mom, pray that they don't detain me,'” her mother said. “God answered us.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Arkansas, Chavez gets her two youngest sons ready each morning for school, then heads home to hop on Zoom calls for work. She leads a business networking initiative she hopes will lead to Springdale's first Latino chamber of commerce.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Her husband, a Brazilian-born chef at a well-known restaurant, helps the younger kids with homework, but she’s the main cook at home, giving him a break from the kitchen. Her oldest son will get married later this year, and the next in line works as a delivery driver. Both are from a previous marriage. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Chavez's bustling life in a brick-sided house looks little like her early start in the United States. She arrived as a teenager and stayed with relatives in Los Angeles until she got a job as a live-in housekeeper, picking up English from the children she cared for. Once she married and had kids of her own, she worked the night shift at a gas station.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She had no driver's license, bank account or Social Security number. That meant limited health benefits and fears she could be deported.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Once Chavez got temporary status, things changed. She got jobs in stores and restaurants, moved to Oklahoma and later Arkansas, and eventually landed work in a chiropractor's office where she brought in Latino clients and helped with Spanish translation. \u003c/p>\u003cp>After her trip to El Salvador, Chavez decided she wanted to do more to give back. She and her sister started a nonprofit to help children in their Salvadoran neighborhood, giving them backpacks and school supplies and a gift and party at Christmas.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For Chavez, who has renewed her status every 18 months, it was eye-opening when the Trump administration announced it would cancel the program for various countries, including El Salvador.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I learned a lot from that, that we’re not safe in this country unless we are citizens,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Salvadorans joined TPS recipients from Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan in litigation aimed at protecting the program and lobbied lawmakers for a more permanent fix. In December, the government granted an extension of TPS as the issue winds through the courts.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The White House transition has brought relief to Chavez and many others with the status, but it still doesn't guarantee her life in the United States. She will still need to repeatedly renew her federal paperwork and with it, her driver's license. She can't travel freely to El Salvador or apply to bring her aging mother, who is too poor to qualify for a travel visa, to be with her.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“She doesn't know her grandchildren,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>TPS also doesn't solve her own immigration problems. Chavez's U.S. citizen husband has sponsored her for a green card, but she would need to get an old immigration court order cleared to be able to apply. She fears doing so could put her at risk for deportation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The bill in Congress could change that, giving her the assurance she’s long dreamed of that she will never be separated from her children.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If there were an amnesty or residency for all those on Temporary Protected Status, I'd automatically be in,” she said. “I'd always be protected from deportation. It would have a big impact.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Taxin reported from Orange County, California, and Alemán from El Salvador.\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"truncatedFirstWords":true,"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Immigration-Next in Line?","headline":"Immigrants with temporary status have grown deep roots in US","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":"858441fb0873460dadcea982bbf1e948","id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:775e2b0ae18d32478db1124efb88a4be","signals":["newscontent"],"etag":"775e2b0ae18d32478db1124efb88a4be_1a14aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":", like Chavez, haven't lived there in decades.\u003c/p>","latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By AMY TAXIN, JEFF ROBERSON and MARCOS ALEMÁN","revision":null,"mediumIds":["858441fb0873460dadcea982bbf1e948","e6969172a257456f865469f3537dfac7","2593a74a629d4768a68574399297536e","29800eb06138486c9e827d1bbff22df2","535e481dc70248b8a4539446abeffad1","52c23c61958040f799178b6e006e12b5","05b575f5bb454686ab0e88b77178bff0","2bf6ab06840d4c32ada7c8580070346d","988c9a5ef0654355a9d8c7ad3610cada","7f6b6cd1a0c14156b274f759a64a817d","e521880e24ed47a99b73b36097ecdca9","005c7311f5b94d0194beefc9c1474c8a"],"media":[{"altText":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","audioMimeType":null,"id":"858441fb0873460dadcea982bbf1e948","alignment":null,"embedCaption":null,"videoRenderedSizes":[640],"title":null,"imageMimeType":"image/jpeg","state":null,"etag":"858441fb0873460dadcea982bbf1e948_0a3aza9c0","externalId":"GuyxC1rbkDs","videoMimeType":"video/mpeg","managementId":"858441fb0873460dadcea982bbf1e948","flattenedCaption":"Immigrants in the U.S. under Temporary Protective Status are hopeful a bill in Congress will give them permanent citizenship.

Enchanted by the state's wide-open spaces, she stayed. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But, in the ensuing decades, dark events have clouded her view of her adopted home. The 1999 massacre at Columbine High School. The 2012 massacre at the Aurora movie theater. On Wednesday, Reinfeld was reeling from the latest mass shooting even closer to home, after authorities say a 21-year-old gunned down shoppers at a local grocery store. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I could see at some point leaving because of all this,” said Reinfeld, a gun control activist. “It's an exhausting way to live.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Colorado has long been defined by its jagged mountains and an outdoor lifestyle that lure transplants from around the country. But it's also been haunted by shootings that have helped define the nation's decades-long struggle with mass violence. The day after the latest massacre, many in the state were wrestling with that history — wondering why the place they live seems to have become a magnet for such attacks. Why here — again?\u003c/p>\u003cp>“People now say, ‘gee, what is it about Colorado?’” said Tom Mauser, whose son Daniel was killed at Columbine High School in 1999. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Mauser, now a gun control advocate, was fielding phone calls in the wake of the new attack — among them was a panicked call from a friend whose daughter was shopping in the supermarket and just escaped the shooting. Again, the violence felt so close. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"4e515500-7c50-11eb-dacb-15ccab607a41\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“It just effects so many people. It's become pervasive,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Colorado isn't the state with the most mass shootings — it ranks eighth in the nation, in the same tier as far larger states like California and Florida, according to Jillian Peterson, a criminology professor at Hamline University in Minnesota.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But it is indelibly associated with some of the most high-profile shootings. The massacre at Columbine High School is now viewed as the bloody beginning of a modern era of mass violence. The Aurora shooting brought that terror from schools to a movie theater.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And there are others with less national prominence. In 2006, a gunman killed a 16-year-old girl after storming a high school in the mountain town of Bailey. The next year, a gunman killed four people in two separate attacks on evangelical Christian churches in suburban Denver and Colorado Springs. Three people died during a 2015 attack on a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs. In 2017, three people were killed at a Walmart by a shooter whose motives were never known. In 2019, 18-year-old Kendrick Castillo was killed fending off an armed attack by two classmates at a suburban Denver high school.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The search for answers leaves no easy explanations. Despite its Western image, Colorado has a fairly typical rate of gun ownership for the country, and its populated landscape has more shopping centers than shooting ranges. It's close to the middle of the pack in terms of its rate of all types of gun violence — 21st in the country, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Peterson, who has written about mass shootings as a viral phenomenon where one gunman is inspired by coverage of other attacks, says the Columbine attack may be one reason Colorado has suffered so much. Two student gunmen killed 13 and “created the script” that many other mass shooters seek to emulate. The attackers died in the massacre but landed on the cover of Time Magazine and were memorialized in movies and books. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Columbine was the real turning point in this country, so it makes sense that, in Columbine's backyard, you'd see more of them,” Peterson said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The attack was nearly a generation ago — the man police named Tuesday as the gunman in the Boulder massacre, Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, was born three days before the Columbine shooting. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Like many young Coloradans, Esteban Luevano, 19, only learned about Columbine in school, as a tragedy that occurred before he was born. But its long shadow terrified him as a child who wondered whether gunmen could storm his school, too. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Then, when Luevano was 11, another gunman opened fire at a movie theater near his house in Aurora, east of Denver and on the opposite side of the metro area from Columbine's leafy suburbs. Twelve people were killed and 70 wounded. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The theater was remodeled after the attack. It sat empty on Tuesday, shuttered during the pandemic, as snow began to swirl and Luevano bundled up to head into a mall across the street. He was still reeling from the idea that the latest Colorado community to join the grim brotherhood was the tony, college town of Boulder.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:10011112896\">Full Coverage: Colorado\u003c/div>\u003cp>“It's pretty fancy, so it kind of shocked me that someone would shoot out there,” Luevano said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Colorado has taken some action to restrict access to guns.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After each of Colorado's biggest massacres, the local gun control movement has gained heartbroken new recruits. Survivors of Columbine and family of the victims there helped push a ballot measure that required background checks for guns purchased at gun shows. After the Aurora attack, the state's newly Democratic Legislature passed mandatory background checks for all purchases and a 15-round limit for magazines.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Those measures led to the recall of two state senators, but the laws endured. After the 2018 Parkland shooting in Florida, the Colorado Legislature passed laws allowing for the confiscation of guns from people engaged in threatening behavior. There has been rebellion from some rural sheriffs, but no recalls now. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Three years ago, the city of Boulder went further and banned assault weapons. A court blocked the measure just 10 days before Monday's rampage. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Gun control activists say one place to observe the impact of mass shootings is in the state's politics. The Republican congressman who represented Aurora was replaced in 2018 by Democratic Rep. Jason Crow, a gun control proponent. In November, the Democratic governor who signed the post-Aurora gun control measures, John Hickenlooper, won a U.S. Senate seat from Colorado's last major statewide elected Republican.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, the appetite for gun rights supporters has not dissipated completely. Coloradans last year also elected Lauren Boebert, a Republican from a rural district who said she wanted to carry a firearm on the floor of the House of Representatives.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Democrat Tom Sullivan, whose son Alex was killed during the Aurora shooting, was elected to a previously-Republican state House district in 2018. On Monday afternoon, he was out with a friend and didn't hear about the latest attack until he came home. \u003c/p>\u003cp>When he did, he turned on the television to watch, something he described as a “pause” to take in all the pain and life stories of the victims.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It's not that we're numb to this, it's that we have a lot of practice,” Sullivan said in an interview.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sullivan argued that Colorado doesn't have an unusually high number of mass shootings. It's just that the relatively wealthy state's backdrop makes the attacks more sensational. “The ones that are happening here in Colorado are happening in a little more affluent areas,” Sullivan said. “It's happening in other places, too, we just can't get people to report on that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Not all touched by the state's history of massacres have become gun control backers. Brian Rohrbough, whose son Daniel was killed at Columbine, said he gets frustrated every time political activists pick up the issue after massacres. Instead, the solution is moral education, he argues.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We're reaping what we've sown because we're afraid, as a state, as a country, to call evil evil,” Rohrbough said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>This story has been corrected to state that the Aurora theater was remodeled after the attack, not torn down and rebuilt.\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"truncatedFirstWords":true,"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Supermarket Shooting-Colorado","headline":"Haunted by mass violence, Colorado confronts painful history","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:1e0d6d89637819656d4aed39a5dc28f0","signals":["newscontent"],"etag":"1e0d6d89637819656d4aed39a5dc28f0_2a11aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":" was killed at Columbine High School in 1999. \u003c/p>","latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By NICHOLAS RICCARDI","revision":null,"mediumIds":["705650052a644fbd8e9de6a50fe5e2ad","c940cef26ca241129281eb02f469059e","25398434b0294fa993387378a7910953","3cc751cd1f17439c85624cfc85839c84","ba6634c34ab249008506c9145a38d6b9","a03ddfe7ec424dcab095981eb420b911","61ae325491974d60b4dbb61b0b9342fb","cd50a1d09ab24599924959ea4084ae14"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/705650052a644fbd8e9de6a50fe5e2ad/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"A solemn group of King Soopers employees, left, some from the Boulder store and some from the same district, brought large displays of flowers for each of the victims of a mass shooting at a Boulder Kings Soopers store on Monday.

(AP) — A handful of coins unearthed from a pick-your-own-fruit orchard in rural Rhode Island and other random corners of New England may help solve one of the planet's oldest cold cases.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The villain in this tale: a murderous English pirate who became the world's most-wanted criminal after plundering a ship carrying Muslim pilgrims home to India from Mecca, then eluded capture by posing as a slave trader.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It's a new history of a nearly perfect crime,” said Jim Bailey, an amateur historian and metal detectorist who found the first intact 17th-century Arabian coin in a meadow in Middletown.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>That ancient pocket change — among the oldest ever found in North America — could explain how pirate Capt. Henry Every vanished into the wind.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On Sept. 7, 1695, the pirate ship Fancy, commanded by Every, ambushed and captured the Ganj-i-Sawai, a royal vessel owned by Indian emperor Aurangzeb, then one of the world's most powerful men. Aboard were not only the worshipers returning from their pilgrimage, but tens of millions of dollars' worth of gold and silver.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What followed was one of the most lucrative and heinous robberies of all time.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Historical accounts say his band tortured and killed the men aboard the Indian ship and raped the women before escaping to the Bahamas, a haven for pirates. But word quickly spread of their crimes, and English King William III — under enormous pressure from a scandalized India and the East India Company trading giant — put a large bounty on their heads.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If you Google ‘first worldwide manhunt,’ it comes up as Every,” Bailey said. “Everybody was looking for these guys.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Until now, historians only knew that Every eventually sailed to Ireland in 1696, where the trail went cold. But Bailey says the coins he and others have found are evidence the notorious pirate first made his way to the American colonies, where he and his crew used the plunder for day-to-day expenses while on the run.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"80239430-7c50-11eb-d375-571fb61085bf\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The first complete coin surfaced in 2014 at Sweet Berry Farm in Middletown, a spot that had piqued Bailey's curiosity two years earlier after he found old colonial coins, an 18th-century shoe buckle and some musket balls.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Waving a metal detector over the soil, he got a signal, dug down and hit literal paydirt: a darkened, dime-sized silver coin he initially assumed was either Spanish or money minted by the Massachusetts Bay Colony.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Peering closer, the Arabic text on the coin got his pulse racing. “I thought, ‘Oh my God,’” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Research confirmed the exotic coin was minted in 1693 in Yemen. That immediately raised questions, Bailey said, since there’s no evidence that American colonists struggling to eke out a living in the New World traveled to anywhere in the Middle East to trade until decades later.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Since then, other detectorists have unearthed 15 additional Arabian coins from the same era — 10 in Massachusetts, three in Rhode Island and two in Connecticut. Another was found in North Carolina, where records show some of Every's men first came ashore.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It seems like some of his crew were able to settle in New England and integrate,” said Sarah Sportman, state archaeologist for Connecticut, where one of the coins was found in 2018 at the ongoing excavation of a 17th-century farm site.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It was almost like a money laundering scheme,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Although it sounds unthinkable now, Every was able to hide in plain sight by posing as a slave trader — an emerging profession in 1690s New England. On his way to the Bahamas, he even stopped at the French island of Reunion to get some Black captives so he’d look the part, Bailey said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Obscure records show a ship called the Sea Flower, used by the pirates after they ditched the Fancy, sailed along the Eastern seaboard. It arrived with nearly four dozen slaves in 1696 in Newport, Rhode Island, which became \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/95ba40e09c67718169ea9d0b6c563664\">a major hub of the North American slave trade\u003c/a> in the 18th century.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There’s extensive primary source documentation to show the American colonies were bases of operation for pirates,\" said Bailey, 53, who holds a degree in anthropology from the University of Rhode Island and worked as an archaeological assistant on explorations of the Wydah Gally pirate ship wreck off Cape Cod in the late 1980s.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Bailey, whose day job is analyzing security at the state's prison complex, has published his findings in a research journal of the American Numismatic Society, an organization devoted to the study of coins and medals.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Archaeologists and historians familiar with but not involved in Bailey's work say they're intrigued, and believe it's shedding new light on one of the world's most enduring criminal mysteries.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Jim's research is impeccable,\" said Kevin McBride, a professor of archaeology at the University of Connecticut. “It's cool stuff. It's really a pretty interesting story.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Mark Hanna, an associate professor of history at the University of California-San Diego and an expert in piracy in early America, said that when he first saw photos of Bailey's coin, “I lost my mind.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Finding those coins, for me, was a huge thing,” said Hanna, author of the 2015 book, “Pirate Nests and the Rise of the British Empire.\" “The story of Capt. Every is one of global significance. This material object — this little thing — can help me explain that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Every’s exploits have inspired a 2020 book by Steven Johnson, “Enemy of All Mankind;” PlayStation’s popular “Uncharted” series of video games; and a Sony Pictures movie version of “Uncharted” starring Tom Holland, Mark Wahlberg and Antonio Banderas that’s slated for release early in 2022.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Bailey, who keeps his most valuable finds not at his home but in a safe deposit box, says he'll keep digging.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“For me, it's always been about the thrill of the hunt, not about the money,” he said. “The only thing better than finding these objects is the long-lost stories behind them.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>This story has been corrected to show that the Arabian coins are among the oldest found in North America, not the oldest.\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"truncatedFirstWords":true,"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Pirate Plunder","headline":"Ancient coins may solve mystery of murderous 1600s pirate","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:f5a6151b74e0dcf96de585eab451f90c","signals":["newscontent"],"etag":"f5a6151b74e0dcf96de585eab451f90c_2a78aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":"t lucrative and heinous robberies of all time.\u003c/p>","latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By WILLIAM J.

(AP) — \u003ca href=\"https://app.doj.mt.gov/enforcement/missingpersons/searchdetail.aspx?RecordKey=30437\">Jermain Charlo\u003c/a> vanished in June 2018. The \u003ca href=\"https://csktribes.org/index.php\">Confederated Salish and Kootenai\u003c/a> tribal member hasn’t been seen since.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Valenda Morigeau, Charlo’s aunt, reported her missing to the Missoula Police Department in the days after her disappearance. But Morigeau said the detective initially assigned to the case failed to take the report seriously and was slow to act, a pattern she said is common when Native Americans report missing loved ones.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“You would think that there would be more urgency to go find the person that is missing,” Morigeau said. “Here we are, three years later, because they assumed she was avoiding responsibilities.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Charlo’s case brought the problem of missing and murdered Indigenous women to the fore in the Confederated Salish and Kootenai tribes. Now, almost three years after her disappearance, the tribes on Thursday became the first in the nation to complete a community response plan — a Justice Department initiative aimed at creating collaboration between law enforcement agencies, including tribal police, county police and federal authorities, when Native Americans go missing on tribal land.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, there are major holes. Among the most glaring: There is no plan for when a tribal citizen goes missing off a reservation or outside tribal lands, as Charlo did. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/missing-in-indian-country\">In 2018, an Associated Press investigation found \u003c/a> that 633 Indigenous women made up 0.7% of open missing persons cases despite being 0.4% of the U.S. population.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The situation is especially alarming in states such as Montana, which have large Native American populations. Native Americans make up less than 7% of Montana’s population but account for 25% of reported missing person cases.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It is not a federal crime for an adult to go missing, and the FBI generally would only step in if there was clear evidence that a crime has been committed that led to a disappearance. The federal government could lend its resources to local law enforcement officials to help in the search.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The things that we will learn and implement from the work that the good people here have done can be utilized nationwide,” said Terry Wade, an FBI executive assistant director, at a news conference Thursday on the Flathead reservation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Justice Department sees its work with local law enforcement and tribal communities as a major initiative. President Donald Trump initiated a federal task force and his \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/025dc5573fdb4952a4ebdcc3212fa560\">then-Attorney General William Barr\u003c/a>, who visited the Flathead Reservation in Montana, committed to hiring 11 coordinators at U.S. attorneys offices across the country.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The new plan aims to increase communication among local law enforcement officials, especially in places where there is overlapping jurisdiction. For example, in the immediate area around the Flathead Reservation, there are eight police and sheriff’s departments in addition to the Montana Highway Patrol, the tribal police and federal investigators.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As part of the initiative, the police departments are now sharing dispatch information, meaning that when one sheriff’s office receives a missing persons report, it can be shared quickly and widely. Also, the U.S. attorney's office and the FBI would offer resources and make a sheriff’s office aware of how the federal government could help.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Craige Couture, police chief for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, said the plan will eventually extend to address cases that occur beyond tribal land and even in other states.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Over the past two years, the federal government has tried to put in place the tribal plans, holding listening sessions and working with tribes to “establish model protocols,” said Ernie Weyand, the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Person coordinator for the Justice Department in Montana.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Weyand, a former FBI official and the first coordinator to be hired, has helped to develop the protocols with other coordinators and tribes across the country.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“They are a community deeply affected by its members who have gone missing or been murdered,” Weyand said in an interview.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Officials around the Flathead Reservation are also working to create a common missing person policy, shared by all the agencies working on the reservation, and have discussed storing information on a secure information server, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It seems to be working. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In early 2020, when 16-year-old Selena Not Afraid disappeared from a New Year's party in Big Horn County, Montana, the reaction was swift and the response from law enforcement was robust. The FBI dispatched its elite child abduction team and offered its vast resources to the local sheriff’s office.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It was too late. But unlike so many others who have never been found, her body was discovered 20 days after she went missing. An autopsy found she died of hypothermia. Her family still questions how she died.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Rae Peppers, a former Montana state House member who has worked to address the crisis through legislation and nonprofit work, said several of the federal initiatives have come across as disingenuous and unproductive.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It looks like we’re at a standstill,” she said, calling Trump’s efforts “a political move and not a compassionate move for the Native people.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>But President Joe Biden's administration has brought the prospect of revitalized efforts. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced Thursday the formation of a new unit within the Bureau of Indian Affairs to address the missing and murdered Indigenous persons crisis, with a goal of coordinating different federal resources to investigate cases.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The move on the part of Haaland marks the fulfillment of a hope by Native activists, including Peppers, that the first American Indian to lead the Department of Interior would bring greater attention to the crisis.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Violence against Indigenous peoples is a crisis that has been underfunded for decades. Far too often, murders and missing persons cases in Indian country go unsolved and unaddressed, leaving families and communities devastated,” Haaland said in a statement. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In tribal communities in Montana, hardly anyone can remain untouched by the crisis. Peppers recounts that no charges were pressed in the killing of her neighbor, who was her husband’s cousin.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Peppers said the Tribal Community Response Plan could prove effective, but it remains to be seen whether such an initiative can translate to all tribal communities and whether it brings real change.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Native Americans who have seen their neighbors and loved ones disappear agree that while the political attention may be new, the problem is not.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s a crisis that has happened clear back to Columbus’ time,” Peppers said. “It’s always been, ‘Oh, another dead Indian.’ That was always the discussion, and it’s still like that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Balsamo reported from New York.

Trump zeroed in on his loss in the state, even as two Democrats won election to the U.S. Senate in January, flipping control of the chamber to their party. The 98-page measure that was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp makes numerous changes to how elections will be administered, including a new photo ID requirement for voting absentee by mail.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Republican supporters say the law is needed to restore confidence in Georgia’s elections. Democrats say it will restrict voting access, especially for voters of color. Here's a look at some of the top issues:\u003c/p>\u003cp>CAN THE STATE TAKE OVER LOCAL ELECTION OFFICES?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Much of the work administering elections in Georgia is handled by the state’s 159 counties. The law gives the State Election Board new powers to intervene in county election offices and to remove and replace local election officials. That has led to concerns that the Republican-controlled state board could exert more influence over the administration of elections, including the certification of county results.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='08e71d7a90ce4a6697fe674d2a3d7a32' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>One target for intervention could be Fulton County, a Democratic stronghold that contains most of Atlanta. The heavily populated county has been plagued by problems, including long lines, and it is often singled out by Republican officials. Under the law, the board could intervene in up to four counties at a time and install a temporary superintendent with the ability to hire and fire personnel including elections directors and poll officers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>ARE PEOPLE BANNED FROM HANDING OUT SNACKS OR WATER TO VOTERS IN LINE?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The new law makes it a misdemeanor to hand out “any money or gifts, including, but not limited to, food and drink” to anyone standing in line to vote. The prohibition extends 150 feet from a polling place and 25 feet from any person standing in line.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Advocates of the law say they are attempting to crack down on political organizations or advocacy groups trying to influence voters just before they cast a ballot. Critics say it’s cruel and would penalize even nonpartisan groups or individuals for something as simple as giving water to someone waiting in a long line. Democratic state Senate Minority Leader Gloria Butler slammed the proposal Thursday before the bill was signed into law, saying: “They want to make it a crime to bring Grandma some water while she’s waiting in line.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Polling places would be able to, but not required to, set up self-serve water dispensers for voters.\u003c/p>\u003cp>DOES THE BILL ELIMINATE SUNDAY VOTING?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Republicans had proposed at one time to limit early voting on weekends, a time when many Black churches conduct “souls to the polls” efforts to take congregants to vote. But Republicans reversed themselves, and the measure now expands weekend early voting. Previously, one day of weekend voting was required, with counties given the option of offering more. Now two Saturdays will be required, and counties can offer two Sunday voting days as well. Republicans point to this provision to argue they are actually expanding, rather than restricting, voting access.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Contrary to the hyper-partisan rhetoric you may have heard inside and outside this gold dome, the facts are that this new law will expand voting access in the Peach State,\" Kemp said Thursday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>HOW WILL RUNOFFS CHANGE?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Georgia is the only state in the nation that mandates runoff elections between the top two finishers following general elections in which no candidate achieves a majority. Like some other states, Georgia also mandates runoffs for candidates who do not win a majority in a party primary.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The system came under scrutiny from Republicans after Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff won twin runoffs in January.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The new law shortens the time for runoffs from nine weeks to four, with lawmakers saying the current span is “exhausting” and needs to be shortened to a “more manageable period.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Military and overseas voters will use ranked-choice absentee ballots to rank all possible candidates before a primary or general election, allowing their preferences to be determined in any possible runoff. Georgia only had three weeks before runoffs until 2013, when a federal judge ordered a longer gap to give military and overseas voters more time to return ballots.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The shorter period means less time for early and mail voting. Early voting had lasted three weeks before runoffs. Now early voting would begin “as soon as possible” but no later than the second Monday before the election, possibly leaving as little as five weekdays and no weekend days of early voting. Voters would also have less time to apply for a mail ballot.\u003c/p>\u003cp>No new voters could be registered in the period before a runoff because the registration deadline would be the day before the earlier election.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT'S NEXT?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Three groups filed a lawsuit late Thursday to try to block the law.

more than a week of fierce fighting including beheaded bodies in the streets, the battle for the northern Mozambique town of Palma has highlighted the southern Africa country’s insurgency and threats to its multibillion-dollar investments.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Here's a look at what is known about the rebel group and the challenges facing Mozambique. \u003c/p>\u003cp>WHO ARE THE REBELS?\u003c/p>\u003cp>They're mostly unemployed young Muslim men from Cabo Delgado, the northernmost province on the country's long Indian Ocean coastline.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For centuries, most people there have been Muslims who traded with Swahili dhow sailors and coexisted with Catholicism brought by Portuguese colonial rulers. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Despite rich natural resources, the province has been one of Mozambique's least developed, with low levels of education, health services, and nutrition. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In recent years some unemployed youths have studied abroad on scholarships from Muslim organizations and locals say many returned preaching a more radical form of Islam. In 2017, violence erupted against government targets by a few small bands, often using machetes to kill police and officials. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The rebels have grown to several hundred, they use motorcycles and are now well-armed with automatic weapons and mortars. Military experts say many weapons come from abroad.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT ARE THEY CALLED?\u003c/p>\u003cp>They are known locally as al-Shabab — Arabic for “youth” — but it seems to be just a handy nickname as they don't have any known affiliation with Somalia's jihadi rebels of the same name. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For a few years, the insurgents didn't appear to be linked to any group, but in 2019, the Islamic State group began claiming responsibility for their attacks, calling them the Islamic State Central African Province. \u003c/p>\u003cp>IS also posts photos and videos of the militants, often standing by the group's black flag. A video posted this week showed them dressed in a mix of camouflage and black shirts and red scarves, and speaking Swahili and some Arabic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>ARE THEY GAINING GROUND?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The number of attacks since 2017 has risen to more than 838, and more than 500 of those have been in the past year, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project. \u003c/p>\u003cp>More than 2,600 people have been killed. The humanitarian crisis has also dramatically increased, from 90,000 displaced at the start of 2020 to more than 670,000 now, according to U.N. organizations. More than 900,000 people in the area need food aid, according to the World Food Program. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>After years of hit-and-run attacks, the rebels captured the port town of Mocimboa da Praia in August and have held it since then. They've attacked smaller towns in the surrounding area. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In one massacre, they beheaded 50 people on a soccer pitch, according to a report confirmed by the Catholic bishop of Pemba, the provincial capital, where hundreds of thousands have fled. The rebels target government offices, kill local officials and rob banks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>HOW IS THE GOVERNMENT RESPONDING?\u003c/p>\u003cp>President Filipe Nyusi's government in Maputo, in the southernmost part of Mozambique, has launched a counterterrorism offensive by the national police and the military. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It also has used a private military organization based in South Africa, the Dyck Advisory Group, which has sent helicopter gunships and other aircraft to find and attack the rebels. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Because the rebels often mingle with civilians, military action is difficult. Atrocities have been committed by all sides — the rebels, the government forces and the mercenaries — according \u003ca href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/03/mozambique-civilians-killed-as-war-crimes-committed-by-armed-group-government-forces-and-private-military-contractors-new-report/\">to a March 2 report \u003c/a> by Amnesty International. The government and the Dyck group deny the charges, saying they are investigating them. \u003c/p>\u003cp>IS MOZAMBIQUE GETTING HELP?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The United States last month declared Mozambique's rebels to be a terror organization and sent special operations forces officers \u003ca href=\"https://mz.usembassy.gov/u-s-government-provides-military-training-to-mozambican-marines/\">to carry out a two-month training\u003c/a> of Mozambique's marines. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Portugal said it's sending 60 officers to provide training and said the European Union is considering military support. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Mozambique is a member of the 16-nation Southern African Development Community, which has been closely watching the instability. The group has had a few meetings on the rebels but Mozambique hasn't yet requested direct military help from neighboring countries, including South Africa and Zimbabwe.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT IS THE ECONOMIC IMPACT?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Rebel violence had caused a suspension of work by the French oil and gas firm Total in January. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On March 24, Total said security had improved enough to allow it to resume, but within a few hours, the rebels attacked Palma, and Total once again evacuated workers from the fortified construction site. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Experts say it will be a long time before stability is sufficiently restored for Total to get back to work. The huge deposits of natural gas are reported to be among the world's largest, and the government was hoping the projects would bring much-needed economic growth. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Exxon also was planning an investment, but that appears to be on hold. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The whole gas gamble was bet on a promise of security, and Nyusi -- and Mozambique -- lost the bet,” wrote academic Joseph Hanlon in the newsletter Mozambique News Reports and Clippings. \u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT IS THE OUTLOOK FOR MOZAMBIQUE AND AFRICA?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The rebels have grown in size and organization. Once viewed as a ragtag bunch of dissatisfied youths, their attacks are more strategic and they are spreading their reach over a large part of northern Cabo Delgado. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Military experts say restoring stability will be a long, violent and challenging process. A more long-range solution would be to improve local governments and provide better services and living conditions, according to analysts and military experts. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But that will be difficult, with the rebels already entrenched. Africa's arc of extremism — from the Sahel region in West Africa, to Nigeria's Boko Haram insurgency in central Africa and al-Shabab's entrenched conflict in Somalia in East Africa — has a new foothold in southern Africa in Mozambique that will be hard to dislodge.\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"truncatedFirstWords":true,"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"AF--Mozambique-Rebels-Explainer","headline":"EXPLAINER: Who are the rebels in northern Mozambique?

family member to the witness stand later. They are trying to portray \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/a55d2662f200ead0da4fed9e923b60a7\">Floyd's complicated life,\u003c/a> from his childhood in Houston’s Third Ward, where he came to be seen as a mentor, to his struggle with drug addiction in Minneapolis.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But the “spark of life” doctrine, which is rare outside Minnesota, is controversial among defense attorneys and could complicate the trial. Here's how legal experts see that playing out:\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT IS THE “SPARK OF LIFE” DOCTRINE?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The doctrine emerged in 1985 when a defendant accused of killing a police officer argued to the Minnesota Supreme Court that the prosecutor prejudiced the jury with a speech about the officer’s childhood, his parents and his marriage. The prosecutor became so emotional the trial court had to take a recess.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The court ruled that prosecutors can present evidence that a murder victim was “not just bones and sinews covered with flesh, but was imbued with the spark of life. The prosecution has some leeway to show that spark and present the victim as a human being as long as it is not an attempt to invoke any undue sympathy or inflame the jury’s passions.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT DID THE JURY LEARN?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ross told jurors that she and Floyd were both drug addicts stemming from their struggles with chronic pain. She said they “tried really hard to break that addiction many times.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’re learning that Floyd is not a perfect person, as none of us are,” said David Schultz, a law professor at the University of Minnesota.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After watching the first days of testimony, Schultz said it was clear prosecutors were “pulling at the emotional strings of the jury” to make a case for convicting \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/8b486c2622de5504f1e65a606b0eac7f\">Derek Chauvin\u003c/a> of the most severe charges.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Chauvin, 45, is charged with murder and manslaughter. Prosecutors say he knelt on Floyd's neck for 9 minutes, 29 seconds, pinning the handcuffed man to the ground. The most serious charge — second-degree murder — against the former officer carries up to 40 years in prison.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“What the spark of life is bringing in, is painting a picture of perhaps Chauvin was indifferent to the problems to the health and the life and safety of George Floyd,” Schultz said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>DID IT BACKFIRE?\u003c/p>\u003cp>When Chauvin's defense attorney Eric Nelson cross-examined Ross, he questioned her on Floyd's drug use, driving hard for her to talk about how Floyd was hospitalized in March 2020 and how she had speculated that it was because he had used heroin. Ross drove Floyd to the emergency room because he was suffering from extreme stomach pain, and she later learned he had overdosed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It was the defense’s best day in terms of testimony,” said F. Clayton Tyler, a prominent local defense attorney. “The fact that he overdosed, I thought that was huge.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Legal experts expect Floyd's cause of death to be key at trial. The defense has argued Floyd’s death was caused by his drug use, underlying health conditions and the adrenaline flowing through his body. An autopsy found fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Attorneys for both sides will bring expert witnesses to provide competing testimony about what killed Floyd. Jurors will have to decide.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s an excellent tactic for the state to try to get jurors to feel sorry for a person because he’s an addict, but in this case, being an addict means he’s violating the law,” said Joe Friedberg, a defense attorney.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some legal experts have said if prosecutors go too far to invoke undue sympathy, Chauvin's defense could have grounds for an appeal. But Friedberg doubted that would happen, saying Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill would halt testimony if it goes too far.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Tyler also reasoned that the defense was bound to highlight Floyd's drug addiction at some point anyway, so by using “spark of life” prosecutors can address it head-on while showing \"who he was as an individual.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press writer Todd Richmond contributed from Madison, Wisconsin.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Find AP’s full coverage of the death of George Floyd at: \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-george-floyd\">https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-george-floyd\u003c/a>\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"truncatedFirstWords":true,"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Explaining George Floyd-Officer Trial-Spark of Life","headline":"EXPLAINER: How Floyd's 'spark of life' played out at trial","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:cc60cbf6f9daa9de09ae9936dd705e6f","signals":["newscontent"],"etag":"cc60cbf6f9daa9de09ae9936dd705e6f_3a7aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":"\u003cp>WHAT IS THE “SPARK OF LIFE” DOCTRINE?\u003c/p>","latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By STEPHEN GROVES","revision":null,"mediumIds":["46c05555f1164fb2a8a5a7c13f3e4424","066c1cf3fbb54f009065dfaff2779c23","aeff9fcbfe7245f2968ebd5a3b8749e0"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/46c05555f1164fb2a8a5a7c13f3e4424/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"In this image from video, witness Courteney Ross answers questions as Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill presides Thursday, April 1, 2021, in the trial of former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin at the Hennepin County Courthouse in Minneapolis, Minn.

The law generally does not recognize the emotional toll on witnesses as a harm, Burkhalter said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Minnesota law, a victim is anyone who incurs “loss or harm as a result of a crime, including a good faith effort to prevent a crime.” Some of the witnesses testified that they sought to stop Chauvin from using force against Floyd, and even called the police to report his actions. They also described the emotional harm they have endured.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The legal distinction between a witness and a victim is important. Victims have rights in criminal cases, including the right to be notified and object to any proposed plea agreements, and to give victim impact statements at sentencing hearings.\u003c/p>\u003cp>DO WITNESSES QUALIFY FOR GOVERNMENT AID TO DEAL WITH THEIR TRAUMA?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Potentially. Witnesses to crimes may apply for mental health counseling and other benefits from the Minnesota Crime Victims Reparations Board.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Eligibility depends on individual circumstances and is decided on a case-by-case basis, said Doug Neville, a spokesman for the Minnesota Department of Public Safety. If approved, they could be eligible for up to $7,500 in counseling and healing services.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT LEGAL PROTECTIONS DO WITNESSES HAVE?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Most of the laws and professional guidelines governing the treatment of witnesses are designed to protect their physical safety against retaliation and limit the inconvenience of having to testify.\u003c/p>\u003cp>National District Attorneys Association guidelines note that one of the greatest needs for witnesses is the assurance of safety against threats, harassment or intimidation. In Minnesota, a prosecutor can take steps to protect witnesses from having to reveal their home or employment addresses, telephone numbers and dates of birth.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Generally, witnesses are also compensated for their time and the expense of testifying, including $20 per day in Minnesota plus mileage and meals. They are to be notified when to show up, with any delays minimized. And employers in Minnesota cannot retaliate against witnesses who have to take time off to testify.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT ABOUT THEIR EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Prosecutors have a duty to present the truth in court proceedings, and that can include gut-wrenching testimony from people who witnessed disturbing and distressing events. \u003c/p>\u003cp>At Chauvin's trial, prosecuting attorneys frequently paused when witnesses were overcome, inviting them to take as much time as they needed. Chauvin's attorney often skipped cross-examining witnesses, including a 9-year-old girl.\u003c/p>\u003cp>How much trauma witnesses have to relive on the stand largely depends on the attorneys' strategies and what evidence the judge allows, said University of Iowa law professor Emily Hughes, a criminal law expert. Some may be unavoidable.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In order for the prosecution to meet their burden and put in the evidence they need, they sometimes do have to put in really hard, traumatic facts,” Hughes said. “At the same time, sometimes the two sides are able to stipulate to certain information to protect witnesses or jurors or people from having to relive an experience like that again. When and how that happens is very much a case-by-case, witness-by-witness or fact-by-fact situation.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Prosecutors have played bystander video of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he lay face-down in handcuffs. They have argued that he persisted even after several onlookers tried to intervene and yelled at him to stop. Chauvin’s defense has argued that the videos show an angry crowd that made it harder to subdue Floyd.\u003c/p>\u003cp>DO WITNESSES WHO ARE MINORS HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Yes. A judge this week sided with prosecutors in blocking live television coverage of the testimony of four witnesses who were minors when they witnessed Floyd’s arrest. He allowed audio of their testimony.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The judge ruled that it would be up to the news media to determine whether to identify those witnesses by their names or to keep them confidential.

Some 6.7 million people had been eligible to cast ballots for 240 lawmakers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a statement on Facebook, Borissov called on his opponents to join forces in a demonstration of political stability in Bulgaria, hinting at the idea of forming a government of experts supported by a broad parliamentary majority.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I offer you peace, let us appoint the experts and until December we can overcome the pandemic and move forward. That is my offer to all of you. Let us choose the best people to do the job. United we are strong,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Borissov, 61, who has led the populist GERB party since its founding in 2006, has governed Bulgaria with an iron grip for most of the last 11 years. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I have always taken into account what the people decide ... Let the elections be honest,” Borissov was quoted as saying after he cast his ballot without reporters present due to pandemic restrictions.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>It could be days before the final official results are announced. If they confirm the exit polls, Borisov will be handed a mandate to form his fourth Cabinet. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It looks, however, that it will be an uphill task for him to find allies to form a stable governing coalition in a fragmented parliament where most groups have already rejected any cooperation with GERB.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political analysts predicted weeks of talks to form a viable coalition and did not exclude the possibility of another election.\u003c/p>\u003cp>President Rumen Radev, a vocal critic of Borissov, urged Bulgarians to turn Sunday's election into the first step toward a return to laws and rules.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I voted against the collapse of statehood, lawlessness and corruption and for a free, just and prosperous Bulgaria,” he said Sunday after voting.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Bulgaria, which joined NATO in 2004 and the European Union in 2007, has been repeatedly criticized for not tackling corruption and for deficiencies in the rule of law and media freedom. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, Borissov on Sunday trumpeted the country's ties with the West.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The immense support we received from our counterparts in Europe shows the importance of a stable European government in Bulgaria,” he said.\u003c/p>","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":16,"shortId":"4a614f1bc6728fca809027f11d105158","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/4a614f1bc6728fca809027f11d105158","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{"europeanunion":{"isPr":null,"name":"european

The game ended after 11 p.m. Saturday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>By the time that happened, Baylor (27-2) was back at the hotel. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We were probably like everyone else on the eighth floor of the hotel,” Baylor coach Scott Drew said of the reaction to The Shot. “Pandemonium erupted.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Bears rolled over Houston 78-59 and, suddenly, they look every bit as unbeatable as the unbeaten Bulldogs (31-0).

The meeting was set for Dec. 5 in Indianapolis — a Final Four preview in the Final Four city, many predicted — but the game got scratched when a Zags player and a staffer tested positive. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The coaches worked hard to try to reschedule. But there was no room on the calendar. Instead, they meet for the title. \u003c/p>\u003cp>This marks the first time since 2005 that the top two teams on the overall seeding list have faced in the final.

My job is just to limit that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>UNDEFEATED\u003c/p>\u003cp>Few and Drew are fishing buddies in the offseason, and pickleball partners in the basketball bubble. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Conceding that it might be a break in COVID-19 protocols, Few said he and the Baylor coach haven't lost a game on the pickleball courts set up at the baseball stadium where teams have gone for fresh air during their semi-quarantined stay in Indianapolis.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The coaches' time together during the tournament has offered them a chance to reflect on their journeys.

“coronavirus status certifications\" over the coming weeks to see if they can allow people to safely return to mass gatherings at sports arenas, nightclubs and concerts.\u003c/p>\u003cp>People attending a range of events this month and in May, including a club night and key FA Cup soccer matches, will need to be tested both before and after. The trials will also gather evidence on how ventilation and different approaches to social distancing could enable large events to go ahead. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Officials are also developing plans to test out COVID-19 passports that are expected to show if a person has received a vaccine, has recently tested negative for the virus, or has some immunity due to having had coronavirus in the previous six months. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The issue of vaccine passports has been a hotly debated topic around the world, including in the United States and Israel. The question is how much governments, employers, venues and other places have a right to know about a person's virus status. Many disagree over what the right balance is between a person's right to medical privacy and the collective right of people in groups not to be infected with a dangerous disease by others. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Some critics also say such vaccine passports will enable discrimination against poor people and impoverished nations that do not have ready access to vaccines. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Authorities in Britain have said the passes could involve the use of an app or paper certificates for those who don't have access to the digital option. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But U.K. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston stressed to reporters that “the earliest pilots almost certainly won't involve any elements of certification” but will involve testing before and after the events. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out more details about the coronavirus passports on Monday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We are doing everything we can to enable the reopening of our country so people can return to the events, travel and other things they love as safely as possible, and these reviews will play an important role in allowing this to happen,” Johnson said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Dozens of British lawmakers, including some from Johnson’s own Conservative Party, have opposed the plans.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Cabinet minister Michael Gove, who has led the task force responsible for drawing up the plans, acknowledged that vaccine passports raised “a host of practical and ethical questions” which needed to be resolved before any wider rollout.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Officials said the trial events include the FA Cup semi-final at London's Wembley Stadium later this month with a crowd of 4,000 in a stadium that seats 90,000, and the event's final on May 15, with a crowd of 21,000. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Other upcoming trial events include the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, central England; a club night at a warehouse and a comedy club event in Liverpool; and three marathon races involving thousands of runners. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The news about the trials came as U.K. businesses including pubs, restaurants, nonessential shops and hairdressers prepared to welcome back customers as restrictions ease in England. Officials say 47% of the country’s population has had a first vaccine dose and more than 5 million people in the U.K. have received their second shot.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Johnson’s government is also expected to set out its approach to easing restrictions on international travel next week. Media reports say when Britain's current ban on foreign holidays is lifted, a risk-based traffic light system with ratings for countries around the world will be introduced and travellers will be required to quarantine accordingly.\u003c/p>\u003cp>More details are to be unveiled when a government task force on global travel reports on April 12. The government has said that international vacation travel cannot take place until mid-May at the earliest.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Last week the U.K. added four more nations to its red list of countries from which travel is banned except for U.K. citizens and those with residency rights. By April 9, the U.K. red list will be up to 39 countries. It aims to prevent more virus variants — especially ones first detected in Brazil and South Africa — from getting into the U.K.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Despite Britain's success on the vaccination front, it still has the highest reported COVID-19 death toll in Europe at around 127,000 deaths. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Infections have come down significantly in Britain. The government on Sunday reported only 2,297 confirmed new daily cases and 10 additional deaths. That compares to nearly 70,000 daily new cases and up to 1,800 daily COVID-19 deaths in January. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The latest figures were likely lower than expected because of a lag in reporting over the Easter weekend.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at \u003ca

Blackwell is a prominent Black civil rights attorney and one of the founders of the Minnesota Association of Black Lawyers. Last year, he won a \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/d2f6c6d9dbf1dc55394d8160ddcfcbaf\">posthumous pardon \u003c/a> for a Black man wrongly convicted of rape before the infamous Duluth lynchings of 1920.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"176e6b40-7c50-11eb-bc47-43519f8e4e00\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But law professors following the case said it's Blackwell's unique ability to translate complicated legal jargon into information jurors can understand that made him the obvious pick to lay out the prosecution's case.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“One of the things he’s known for is his ability to speak English rather than ‘legalese,’” said Joseph Daly, emeritus professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota. “It’s extremely important in this case just to try to explain what the elements of the crimes are that Mr. Chauvin is charged with.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIN ELDRIDGE QUESTIONED TWO OF THE YOUNGEST WITNESSES. WHY?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Eldridge joined the Minnesota attorney general’s office in 2018. Before that, she served as a special assistant U.S. attorney in Nebraska and the Northern District of Iowa.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jonathan Simon, a professor at University of California Berkeley School of Law, noted that our culture associates women with “being more caretaking toward children, toward juveniles.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Using Eldridge as the questioner may help to \"ease the witnesses' experience and get their testimony as effectively as possible, but also to help the jury see this in the most sympathetic light,” Simon said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Daly said Eldridge \"was particularly adept at showing empathy and kindness and a certain softness, which I think is really important when you’re questioning children.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>When an 18-year-old witness, Alyssa Funari, began to cry, Eldridge told her to take her time and offered a tissue.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Is this difficult for you to talk about?” Eldridge asked. “Do you need a minute?”\u003c/p>\u003cp>IS THERE A DRAWBACK TO USING SO MANY DIFFERENT PROSECUTORS?\u003c/p>\u003cp>St. Louis University School of Law professor Sue McGraugh said she sought to make a personal connection with jurors when she was a prosecutor. She said she's rarely seen a case with so many prosecutors, and that it carries some risk.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s unusual because, as someone who has tried a lot of cases, you do want the jury to form some sort of attachment to someone on the legal team,” McGraugh said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>SO, WHY SO MANY?\u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s evidence of the stakes in the trial that Daly called “possibly one of the most important cases ever in the United States and possibly the world.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz appointed Attorney General Keith Ellison to handle the prosecution just days after Floyd's death, and Ellison vowed to utilize whatever resources were necessary.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:10059966943\">Full Coverage: Death of George Floyd\u003c/div>\u003cp>Frank and Schleicher have handled the lion's share of questioning since the trial began. Frank is a 21-year veteran of the attorney general’s office and has led the criminal division for 14 years. Daly called Frank “the most experienced and skilled lawyer in the criminal division of the attorney general’s office.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Schleicher is a veteran trial attorney and prosecutor who works for the law firm Maslon LLP. He spent 13 years in the U.S. attorney’s office and was a prosecutor in the case of \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/1cbb965d61f143a08c4c224220b9be43\">Danny Heinrich\u003c/a>, who confessed in 2016 that he killed 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling in 1989, and led authorities to his body. \u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT IS THE FULL DEPTH OF THE PROSECUTION TEAM?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The prosecution team has 13 lawyers, said John Stiles, Ellison's spokesman, and a 14th acted as a jury consultant.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ellison, Frank and Eldridge are the only ones who work in the attorney general's office. The team also includes Assistant Hennepin County Attorney Joshua Larson and nine outside attorneys. Stiles said the outside attorneys are all working pro bono, or without pay.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The roster behind the scenes is deep. Perhaps the best-known player is Neal Katyal, former U.S. acting solicitor general who has argued dozens of cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. Katyal led a successful effort to get a third-degree murder charge reinstated against Chauvin after the judge initially ruled it didn't fit the circumstances.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Stiles said in an email that about half of the outside attorneys are working full-time on the case.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT ABOUT THE DEFENSE?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nelson is the lone defense attorney, aided in court by a legal assistant who is also an attorney but who hasn't taken part in the courtroom arguments. The defense is funded through the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association’s legal defense fund.

Most are operating at 50% capacity or less. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Godzilla vs. Kong” stomped to $32.2 million from Friday to Sunday, according to studio estimates Sunday. The five-day total far exceeded expectations, and even outpaced the three-day debut ($47.8 million) of the franchise's last entry, 2019's “Godzilla: King of the Monsters.” Globally, “Godzilla vs. Kong” grossed $120.1 million over the weekend, bringing its two-week worldwide total to $285.4 million.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Made for approximately $160 million, “Godzilla vs. Kong” is one of a small handful of big-budget movies to open in theaters. WarnerMedia, which owns Warner Bros. and HBO Max, hedged its bet, though, by streaming the film to subscribers in North America at the same time — a strategy it's pursuing for all 2021 releases. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The studio didn't offer viewing data Sunday but said “Godzilla vs. Kong” had a larger audience on HBO Max than any film or TV show since the service's launch in 2020. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But clearly the clash of two of the movies' most iconic big guys was enough to drive more people — whether they have HBO Max accounts or not — to the big screen more than anything else over the past the year. After a punishing year for theaters, it's one of the most promising signs in ages that moviegoing can be revived after a punishing pandemic year. \u003c/p>\u003cp>David A. Gross, who runs the movie consultancy FranchiseRe, estimated that “Godzilla vs. Kong” would have debuted with a $50 million three-day weekend and $500 million worldwide if not for the pandemic. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“While it’s half of what it would be under normal circumstances, the weekend is a clear and positive indication that moviegoing has inherent strengths that aren’t going away, including going out for the group experience; the big screen quality; and the value for cost,” Gross said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Godzilla vs. Kong” had already launched with $123.1 million internationally last weekend, led by especially strong ticket sales in China. There, it opened with $70 million, surpassing the performance of previous entries in the franchise. This weekend, it added another $44 million, Legendary said. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Moviegoers have been waiting for an event film like ‘Godzilla vs. Kong’ to arrive on the big screen and the numbers don’t lie — it’s clear that wherever audiences are ready to safely return to the theater, they have, and we’re thrilled with the results,\" Jeff Goldstein, distribution chief for Warner Bros., said in a statement.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A new series of movies was restarted in 2014 with “Godzilla,” followed by 2017's “Kong: Skull Island” and 2019's “Godzilla: King of Monsters.” Returns have been steadily diminishing. The previous three films opened domestically with $200.7 million, $168.1 million and $47.8 million, respectively. But the franchise had been leading up to the prize fight of “Godzilla vs. Kong.\" Directed by Adam Wingard, its human co-stars include Alexander Skarsgård, Brian Tyree Henry and Rebecca Hall. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The pandemic high had belonged to “Wonder Woman 1984,” which launched with $16.7 million in December. The previous best opening of 2021 in North America was “Tom &amp; Jerry,” with $13.7 million in late February. That gives Warner Bros. the top three movies of the last year, all distributed in a hybrid release plan in both theaters and on HBO Max for a 30-day period. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Theater owners seized on the film's performance as proof that moviegoers are ready to return to theaters, and Hollywood should release more of the big-budget films it has withheld during the pandemic. In the past month, theaters reopened in the U.S.'s two largest markets — New York and Los Angeles — which were both the top markets for “Godzilla vs. Kong.” Also driving sales were private or “pod” bookings of an entire theater, of which the Warner Bros. release had more than 10,000. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The film drew mostly younger moviegoers. According to the studio, 72% were under the age of 35. “Godzilla vs. Kong,” which has received mostly positive reviews from critics, scored an “A” CinemaScore from audiences.

Saints decried abortion as evil and issued another plea for members to combat prejudice and racism during the first day of a church conference taking place Saturday without attendees because of the pandemic. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The faith known widely as the Mormon church has long opposed abortion, but addressed it only sparingly in recent years. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Lawmakers in Republican-governed Legislatures in the United States are considering an array of anti-abortion restrictions this year that they hope might reach the Supreme Court and win approval from its conservative majority, overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a nationwide right to abortion.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Citing a speech by former church President Gordon B. Hinckley from a 1998 conference, church leader Neil Andersen said abortion is “evil, stark and real and repugnant\" and pleaded with women to avoid considering it. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Let us share our deep feelings about the sanctity of life with those who make decisions in society,” Andersen said. “They may not fully appreciate what we believe, but we pray that they will more fully understand why, for us, these decisions go well beyond just what a person wants for his or her own life.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Andersen, a member of a top governing panel called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, said church members should step in to help support women if an unanticipated child is coming to allow a child to be born and continue the baby's “journey in mortality.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>He also lamented that fewer children are being born around the world, even in the most prosperous countries. \u003c/p>\u003cp>That trend could be seen in new church statistics released Saturday that showed the number of new children added to church membership rolls declined for the sixth consecutive year. About 65,500 children were added to church membership in 2020 — down 47% from a modern peak reached in 2008, church figures show. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Also on Saturday, Quorum member Gary Stevenson called on church members to be welcoming to people of all faiths and ethnicities on the heels of recent attacks on Asians and following a recent reckoning over racial justice around the world. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The Lord expects us to teach that inclusion is a positive means towards unity, and that exclusion leads to division,” Stevenson said. “We have been heartbroken to hear of recent attacks on people who are Black, Asian, Latino, or of any other group. Prejudice, racial tension, or violence should never have any place in our neighborhoods, communities, or within the church.” \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>He also called on young members to stop cyber-bullying, which can lead to anxiety and depression, and for adults to model “kindness, inclusion and civility.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Stevenson's plea marked a continuation of a push in recent years by church leadership to strike a more strident tone against racism. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Fellow church leaders urged members to root out racism and make the faith an “oasis of unity\" at the last church conference in October. Two months later, the church added to the faith’s handbook new language demanding members root out prejudice and racism, adding significance and permanence on one of the most sensitive topics in the church’s history.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The faith’s past ban on Black men in the lay priesthood, which stood until 1978, remains a delicate issue for members and non-members alike. The church disavowed the ban in a 2013 essay, saying it was enacted during an era of great racial divide that influenced the church’s early teachings, but it never issued a formal apology — a sore spot for some members.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Church leadership grew a bit more diverse in 2018 when it selected the first-ever Latin American and person of Asian ancestry to an all-male top governing panel. But there are still no Black men on the panel. Black members make up a tiny percentage of church membership.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Members of the Utah-based faith known widely as the Mormon church are watching speeches during the two-day conference this Easter weekend on TVs, computers and tablets from their homes around the world. Church leaders are giving the speeches from inside a building at church headquarters in Salt Lake City, where they are sitting socially distanced and wearing masks. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Before the pandemic, the two-day conference would bring about 100,000 people to the church’s headquarters in Salt Lake City to listen to five sessions over two days. The conference was held virtually in April 2020, marking the first time that occurred in more than 70 years.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Church President Russell M. Nelson, now in his third year leading the faith, and several speakers focused on the importance of repentance. Comparing self-growth to ongoing renovations at the church's flagship temple in Salt Lake City, Nelson told members to find “debris you should remove from your life so you can become more worthy.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Dieter Uchtdorf, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, added: \"The cleansing gift of repentance allows us to leave our sins behind and emerge a new creature.

Francis in his traditional Easter Sunday address denounced as “scandalous” how armed conflicts continue to rage even as the coronavirus pandemic has triggered severe social and economic suffering and

pain from the globe's many armed conflicts in Africa, the Mideast, Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Describing vaccines as an ”essential tool” in the pandemic battle, Francis called for a “spirit of global responsibility” as he encouraged nations to overcome “delays in the distribution of vaccines” and ensure that the shots reach the poorest nations.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv

\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The pandemic is still spreading, while the social and economic crisis remains severe, especially for the poor. Nevertheless — and this is scandalous — armed conflicts have not ended, and military arsenals are being strengthened,'' Francis said, sounding angry. “That is today's scandal.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The pontiff prayed that public authorities would see to it that those needing assistance have a “decent standard of living. Sadly, the pandemic has dramatically increased the number of the poor and the despair of thousands of people.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>He lamented the plight of people afflicted by war and other conflicts, citing Haiti, one of the world's poorest countries and which has been wracked by violent protests and political strife including an alleged coup. Francis urged Haitians “not to be overwhelmed by difficulties, but to look to the future with confidence and hope.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Francis offered encouragement to young people in Myanmar who are “committed to supporting democracy and making their voices heard peacefully.” Demonstrators in Myanmar took to the streets holding painted eggs in a reference to Easter. Myanmar's military has violently sought to quash those opposed to a Feb. 1 coup that ousted a democratically elected government. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Francis thanked Lebanon and Jordan for taking in refugees from war in Syria, praying that peace finally comes to “millions are living in inhumane conditions.” He also prayed for ends to conflicts in Yemen and Libya.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Citing suffering of people in Africa, he decried “internal violence and international terrorism, especially in the Sahel and Nigeria.\" Other troubled areas he mentioned were Ethiopia's Tigray province and Mozambique's Cabo Delgado province, which has been blooded by days of fighting with rebels for control of a town.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Francis prayed for the safe return home of prisoners of long conflicts in Europe, in eastern Ukraine and in Nagorno-Karabkh.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Earlier in the day, Francis celebrated Easter Mass in St. Peter's Basilica, where the faithful in the pews barely numbered 200 in keeping with pandemic protocols, compared to the usual thousands. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Normally, Francis would give his Easter speech about world affairs is delivered from the central balcony of the basilica overlooking St. Peter's Square. Instead, for the second consecutive Easter, he read it indoors to discourage crowds from gathering.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Dear brothers and sisters, once again this year, in various places, many Christians have celebrated Easter under severe restrictions and, at times, without being able to attend liturgical celebrations,” Francis said, before offering a special Apostolic blessing to faithful worldwide.

a massive infusion of federal aid coming their way, schools across the U.S. are weighing how to use the windfall to ease the harm of the pandemic — and to tackle problems that existed long before the coronavirus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The assistance that was approved last month totals $123 billion — a staggering sum that will offer some districts several times the amount of federal education funding they receive in a single year. The aid will help schools reopen and expand summer programs to help students catch up on learning. It also offers a chance to pursue programs that have long been seen as too expensive, such as intensive tutoring, mental health services and major curriculum upgrades.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“This feels like a once-in-a-generation opportunity for us to be able to make critical investments,\" said Nathan Kuder, chief financial officer of Boston Public Schools, which is expecting $275 million.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the spending decisions carry high stakes. If important needs are overlooked — or if the money does not bring tangible improvements — schools could face blowback from their communities and from politicians who influence their funding. At the same time, schools must be wary of dreaming too big and taking on long-term costs they cannot sustain.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said the assistance allows schools to “hit the reset button” and confront challenges that have long plagued the nation’s education system. He said schools can train teachers in social and emotional learning and work to close persistent racial disparities in education.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“With successful implementation, our students are going to have a better experience than they did before the pandemic,” Cardona said in an interview.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Districts with higher concentrations of poverty will get the largest sums. Public schools in some cities are expected to receive more than $1 billion, including Los Angeles and Philadelphia. The new money joins more than $67 billion made available to schools in other relief packages during the pandemic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Schools must reserve 20% for summer programs and other efforts to address learning loss, but they expect to have wide flexibility in how to use most of the aid. With more than three years to spend the new money, school leaders are thinking big.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Officials in Boston say the aid will be used to reopen, recover and “reimagine what is possible for our students,” Kuder said. The money will help update aging buildings, but it could also be used to start new dual-language programs or revamp the curriculum, he said. Ultimately, officials plan to ask residents what changes they want to see.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In Tulsa, Oklahoma, where 83% of students come from low-income families, the district expects to get $120 million — nearly three times the amount it gets in federal education funding in a typical year. Along with building upgrades, the aid will help achieve a goal to provide summer programs and after-school care in every neighborhood, officials said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We plan to use this moment to consider how we can bring about lasting change for our school district,” Superintendent Deborah Gist said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>School officials in Hartford, Connecticut, say they have lined up a list of “must-win” spending areas. Superintendent Leslie Torres-Rodriguez said the district plans to “radically expand” learning options outside the school day, cultivate a pipeline of new teachers and expand the role of schools in their communities.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The district also hopes to buy new curriculum materials across all grades and subjects, a goal that was previously out of reach. “It is something that we’ve never been able to do,” Torres-Rodriguez said. “All that we’ve been able to afford is a little bit here and a little bit there.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Even though the funding brings a bonanza for some districts, questions loom around other sources of financial support. Some states have already slashed education budgets as they face steep revenue losses, and other states are likely to follow, which could diminish the effect of the federal dollars.\u003c/p>\u003cp>To keep future costs in check, many schools are avoiding big hiring increases, and few are pursuing programs that carry heavy personnel costs. Instead, many will consider adding teachers under short-term agreements or hiring contractors to provide social and mental health services.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Virginia Beach, officials are weighing whether to add teachers under one-year contracts, with a focus on recruiting retirees or others outside the teaching profession. The district is also exploring whether to train current teachers in high-demand subjects and to add mental health services through a telehealth provider.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s a substantial increase, but it’s important to understand that these are not ongoing funds,” Superintendent Aaron Spence said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The top goal is to get students back in the classroom. In Detroit schools, which expect to receive $800 million, much of the aid will be used on ventilation systems and to pay the costs associated with smaller classes and social distancing. Some of it is expected to go toward hazard pay for teachers who return to the classroom.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And while the funding is largely intended to reverse the setbacks caused by a year of remote learning, there’s also a push to sustain virtual options. At Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland, officials are expanding summer learning, but they also plan to start a virtual academy for students with health concerns and those who thrived under remote learning.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Akron, Ohio, a large, urban district that expects to get $96 million in new aid, Chief Financial Officer Ryan Pendleton said the money offers the potential to “forever change education for the better.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It is a wonderful, wonderful opportunity from a terrible pandemic.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press writers Michael

coronavirus vaccines.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Unlike other Gulf Arab states that have administered doses to masses of foreign workers in a race to reach herd immunity, Kuwait has come under fire for vaccinating its own people first. \u003c/p>\u003cp>That leaves legions of laborers from Asia, Africa and elsewhere, who clean Kuwaiti nationals' homes, care for their children, drive their cars and bag their groceries, still waiting for their first doses, despite bearing the brunt of the pandemic. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“The only people I've seen at the vaccination center were Kuwaiti,\" said a 27-year-old Kuwaiti doctor, who like most people interviewed for this story spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of government reprisals. “Kuwait has a citizens-first policy for everything, including when it comes to public health.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Kuwaiti authorities did not respond to repeated requests for comment from The Associated Press on their vaccination strategy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>When Kuwait’s vaccination registration site went live in December, authorities declared that health-care workers, older adults and those with underlying conditions would be first in line. As weeks ticked by, however, it became increasingly clear the lion's share of doses was going to Kuwaitis, regardless of their age or health. Initially, some expat medical workers said they couldn't even get appointments. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Kuwait’s labor system, which links migrants’ residency status to their jobs and gives employers outsized power, prevails across the Gulf Arab states. But hostility toward migrants long has burned hotter in Kuwait. The legacy of the 1991 Gulf War, which triggered mass deportations of Palestinian, Jordanian and Yemeni workers whose leaders had supported Iraq in the conflict, fueled anxiety about the need for self-reliance in Kuwait that endures today — even as Southeast Asian laborers rushed to fill the void. \u003c/p>\u003cp>A 30-year-old Indian woman who has spent her whole life in Kuwait watched her Instagram feed fill with celebratory photos of Kuwaiti teenagers getting the jab. Her father, a 62-year-old diabetic with high blood pressure, could not — like the rest of her relatives living there.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“All the Kuwaitis I know are vaccinated,” she said. “It's more than just annoying, it's a realization that no, this is not cool, there is no way to feel like I belong here anymore.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Kuwait has vaccinated its citizens at a rate six times that of non-citizens, the Health Ministry revealed earlier this year. At the time, despite some 238,000 foreigners registering online to book an appointment, only 18,000 of them — mostly doctors, nurses and well-connected workers in state oil companies — were actually called in to receive the vaccine. Meanwhile, some 119,000 Kuwaitis were vaccinated. \u003c/p>\u003cp>With vaccine information only available in English or Arabic, advocates say that locks out scores of low-wage laborers from Southeast Asia who speak neither language.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The disparity set off a roiling debate on social media, with users decrying what they called the latest instance of xenophobia in Kuwait. They say the pandemic has magnified resentment of migrant workers, deepened social divides and hardened the government's resolve to protect its own people first. Medical professionals warned Kuwait's inoculation hierarchy damages public health. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Compared to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, among the world’s fastest vaccinators per capita, Kuwait’s drive has lagged. While foreigners wait for shots, medical workers say Kuwaiti citizens remain reluctant to register because of vaccine conspiracy theories shared widely on social media. Infections have soared, prompting the government to impose a strict nightly curfew last month. \u003c/p>\u003cp>With pressure mounting on the Health Ministry, barriers eased in recent weeks, with a growing number of foreign residents 65 years of age and older reporting they were able to get vaccinated. Still, most expats insist the inequality in access remains striking. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We are waiting and waiting for the call,” said a 55-year-old house cleaner from Sri Lanka. “The moment I get the call, I will go. I need the vaccine to be safe.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The government has not released a demographic breakdown of vaccinated foreigners vs. Kuwaitis since the outrage over the inequality erupted in mid-February, only overall vaccination statistics. As of this week, 500,000 people have received at least one dose of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca, according to health authorities. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Even as the bulk of front-line workers in grocery stores and cafes remain unvaccinated, Kuwait is making plans to reopen society for the inoculated. Those who can prove they got the jab will be able to attend schools in the fall, go to cinemas in the spring and skip quarantine after flying into the country, the government announced.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Foreign workers in Kuwait have felt this frustration before. When the pandemic first struck, lawmakers, talk show hosts and prominent actresses blamed migrants for the virus’s spread. \u003c/p>\u003cp>As the coronavirus ripped through crowded districts and dormitories where many foreigners live, authorities imposed targeted lockdowns and published surging virus counts with a breakdown of nationalities. When infections among Kuwaitis rose, the government stopped releasing demographic data. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It's easy for migrants to be seen as the root of all problems in Kuwait,\" said Rohan Advani, a researcher of sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Citizens don’t have political or economic power, so when they don’t like what’s happening to their country, blaming foreigners becomes the main outlet.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Despite having an outspoken parliament, final power in Kuwait rests with the ruling emir. Kuwaiti citizens, who are guaranteed spots on the public payroll and reap the benefits of a cradle-to-grave welfare state, increasingly have clamored for policies that limit the flow of migrants. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Earlier this year, the government banned the renewal of visas for expats over 60 without college degrees, effectively expelling an estimated 70,000 people, including many who have lived in Kuwait for decades.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This discrimination is not new for us. The pandemic has just highlighted the worst of it,” said a 30-year-old Lebanese woman who grew up in Kuwait and whose older relatives are still waiting for vaccines. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“But this is life and death,\" she said. “I never really thought it would reach this point.”\u003c/p>","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":2,"shortId":"ffd655cc669a9296d60a8efd47ae2682","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/ffd655cc669a9296d60a8efd47ae2682","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{"kuwaitgovernment":{"isPr":null,"name":"kuwait government","canonicalName":null,"order":0}},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"xxUpdated":"2021-04-04 23:08:20","socialEmbeds":null,"flattenedFirstWords":"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — In the tiny, oil-rich sheikhdom of Kuwait, the foreigners who power the country's economy, serve its society and make up 70% of its population are struggling to...","id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:ffd655cc669a9296d60a8efd47ae2682","media":[],"disableConnatix":false,"hons":false,"headlinePlacement":null,"revision":null,"videoContext":null,"description":null,"embargoDate":null,"reporterKeys":["afs:Reporter:8143483163"],"omitFromFeed":false,"sponsored":false,"storyLayout":null,"tagIds":["Dubai","apf-topnews","UnitedArabEmirates","Kuwait","apf-mideast","apf-WorldNews","Coronaviruspandemic","Coronavirusvaccine","Economy"],"hasTextOverlay":false,"bylines":"By ISABEL DEBRE","leadPhotoId":"a12b6a766f1a4d518c7f03e72561f5a8"}],"notificationUrl":null,"textColor":null,"sponsorUrl":null,"teamLimit":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","omitFromFeed":false,"isFullScreen":false,"topLineColor":null,"sponsorServeAd":false,"notificationText":null,"endDateTime":null,"notificationTypeId":null,"notificationUpdated":null},{"feed":[],"pollUpdated":null,"headlineWidget":false,"height":null,"dividerColor":null,"tagObjs":[],"hideDate":false,"virtual":true,"poll_key":null,"sponsorImageUrl":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"borderColor":null,"cardTitle":null,"archived":false,"localMemberName":null,"ignoreAlertMedia":false,"collectionTagObjs":[],"notificationTitle":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"pollFilters":{},"shortId":"9e2162cbbaae2ade1ef3131fbab55667","allowAd":true,"layoutType":"Small Photo","pollWeek":null,"sound":null,"disclaimerText":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"xxUpdated":null,"sponsorAttribution":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"hubPositions":null,"textScale":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"customLayoutType":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"cardHeadline":null,"teams":[],"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:9e2162cbbaae2ade1ef3131fbab55667","pollId":null,"hideOtherTeams":false,"displayPositionHome":null,"contents":[{"block_fundamentals":true,"embedHeight":null,"stackedStory":false,"contentSponsor":null,"mediumIds":["14c6de6027fa4ddeabc9eacae9f46d70"],"old_lead_video_key":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"title":"US--People-DMX","headline":"Rapper DMX on life support after heart attack, lawyer says","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"signals":["newscontent"],"etag":"9e2162cbbaae2ade1ef3131fbab55667_3a34aza0c0","latestEtag":null,"updated":"2021-04-04 04:09:31","contentType":"text","canonicalUrl":"new-york-white-plains-hip-hop-and-rap-music-dmx","embedRatio":null,"audioMediumIds":[],"layoutType":"Small Photo","tagObjs":[{"canonicalName":"entertainment","order":7,"id":"apf-entertainment","isPr":null,"name":"Entertainment"},{"canonicalName":"us-news","order":7,"id":"apf-usnews","isPr":null,"name":"U.S. News"},{"canonicalName":"new-york","order":0,"id":"NewYork","isPr":null,"name":"New York"},{"canonicalName":"ap-top-news","order":9,"id":"apf-topnews","isPr":null,"name":"AP Top News"},{"canonicalName":"white-plains","order":0,"id":"WhitePlains","isPr":null,"name":"White Plains"},{"canonicalName":"hip-hop-and-rap","order":0,"id":"Hiphopandrap","isPr":null,"name":"Hip hop and rap"},{"canonicalName":"music","order":2,"id":"apf-Music","isPr":null,"name":"Music"},{"canonicalName":"dmx","order":0,"id":"DMX","isPr":null,"name":"DMX"}],"disableNativo":false,"alertLinkDateTime":null,"embedCaption":null,"version":null,"leadVideoAutoEmbed":true,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:9e2162cbbaae2ade1ef3131fbab55667","embedLinkURL":null,"language":null,"leadVideoId":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>DMX’s longtime New York-based lawyer, Murray Richman, said the rapper was on life support Saturday evening at White Plains Hospital.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He had a heart attack.

And instead of investing my time and energy into it now, knowing how these things go, I’d rather be pleasantly surprised,” the Los Angeles resident said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Marlene Gillings-Gayle said she had planned not to watch the trial to preserve her peace of mind. But she’s found herself watching almost all of it. She's had to force herself to go outside and take walks, or risk watching the trial all day and feeling upset. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The retired high school teacher who lives in New York City describes herself as a political person who likes to stay aware of current events and vocalize her opinions. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m trying not to be pissed, because we’ve been here and done that too many times,” she said, referring to other police officers acquitted in the deaths of unarmed Black people. She’s watching the trial with apprehension, as she ponders what Floyd's killing and the way the trial has unfolded so far says about America and its values. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Chauvin, 45, who was eventually fired from the police force, is accused of killing a handcuffed Floyd last May by pinning his knee on the 46-year-old Black man’s neck for 9 minutes, 29 seconds, as he lay face-down. Floyd had been accused of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a neighborhood market. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The first week of the trial has included emotional testimonies from several people who witnessed Floyd’s death: The young woman, a teenager at the time, who filmed Floyd’s last moments and told the courtroom she stays “up nights apologizing to George Floyd;” the 61-year-old man who sobbed on the stand, compelling the judge to order a 10-minute recess; the firefighter who begged officers to let her check Floyd’s pulse as he gasped for air, saying, “I was desperate to help.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>The \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/how-derek-chauvin-trial-impacted-witnesses-b9b609964ed5ec161b5255187ab246a6\">grief and trauma of these witnesses \u003c/a> has been on full display, filling in details from new perspectives to create a fuller picture of the scene that people around the world watched over cellphone video last May. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For Kyra Walker, it was enough to tune out and shut down Twitter one day. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I realized I just didn’t have it in me to watch all this,” she said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Floyd’s death was traumatizing enough for Walker, but seeing conversations about the trial on Twitter this week brought back a flood of emotions she has grappled with over the course of the last year. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I had a moment where I just felt broken and I started thinking about Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor and how in such a short time frame, it was like one Black death after the other, without a break,” she said. It has made her feel paranoid at times for her 11-year-old Black son anytime he leaves home. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The trial is only furthering the uneasiness many felt when the video of Chauvin pressing his knee to Floyd’s neck started to circulate online. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It took me a while to watch it because I know what these videos are about. I know the ending already,” Thompson said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Leigh Smith, a logistics operations manager who lives in the Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe Park, said he has tuned in each day of the trial. He calls some of the testimony “freaking depressing.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“You catch a murder on camera and you’re going to explain away to me that this man died of a heart attack?” Smith said of Floyd. “All this does is reaffirm the hatred and entrenchment of white supremacy and white domination over communities of color.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Brenda Hill, 57, of Detroit watched every video during every minute of the trial’s first two days. Hill, who works for a nonprofit that advocates for low-wage workers, isn’t so sure the rest of the country is viewing the trial — or how African Americans continue to be treated — through the same lens.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We don’t have any trust in this criminal justice system,” she said. “I should be assured that by this time everyone saw what I did. I’m disgusted, I’m hurt by everything.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>As witnesses and attorneys in the courtroom recount the final moments of Floyd’s life in detail, the emotional trauma many Black Americans have felt over the last several years is resurfacing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Our country needs counseling,” Gillings-Gayle said. “The witnesses have been grieving and suffering for the last 10 months.

The fencing had been erected to secure the Capitol after the violent mob of of then-President Donald Trump’s supporters attacked the building Jan. 6., interrupting the certification of President Joe Biden's victory. The violence lead to the deaths of five people, including a Capitol Police officer. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='578a81d342c0465586cc136f443392de' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Police, who took the brunt of the assaults that day, have left intact a second ring of fencing around the inner perimeter of the Capitol as they struggle to figure out how to best protect the building and those who work inside it. That tall, dark fencing — parts of it covered in razor wire until just recently -- is still a stark symbol of the fear many in the Capitol felt after the mob laid siege two months ago. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Lawmakers have almost universally loathed the fencing, saying the seat of American democracy was meant to be open to the people, even if there was always going to be a threat. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But after Friday’s attack, some said they needed to procced with caution. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s an eyesore, it sucks,” Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio said about the fencing. “Nobody wants that there. But the question is, is the environment safe enough to be able to take it down? In the meantime, maybe that fence can prevent some of these things from happening.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ryan, chairman of a House spending committee that oversees security and the Capitol, stressed that no decisions had been made, and that lawmakers would be “reviewing everything\" after the latest deadly incident. His committee and others are looking at not only the fence but at the staffing, structure, and intelligence capabilities of the Capitol Police. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The scab got ripped off again here today,” Ryan said. “So we've got to figure this out.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement Saturday that Evans' death “has only added to the need to address security at the Capitol in a comprehensive way\" after the January breach. Along with Ryan's House panel, two Senate committees have been looking into what changes need to be made. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Despite the fencing, Friday's breach happened inside the perimeter. The driver slipped through a gate that had opened to allow traffic in and out of the Capitol and rammed a barrier that had protected the building long before Jan. 6. And there was no evidence that Green's actions were in any way related to the insurrection. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, it was a reminder that there is always a target on one of the country's most visible public buildings, especially as political tensions have risen since the insurrection and there has been broad public scrutiny of the security failures that day. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“This may just cause everybody to pump the brakes a bit on taking the fence down entirely because of the sense of security that it provides us,” said Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton of Virginia, another member of the spending panel that oversees the legislative branch. \u003c/p>\u003cp>As a lawmaker who represents the suburbs of Washington, Wexton said she wants to see the Capitol open again to visitors. While the indoor parts of the building have been closed to the public for the last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, the plazas, roads and sidewalks that surround the Capitol were only cut off after the riot, keeping the public completely away from the area.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I would like to see it come down at the earliest possible moment,” Wexton said of the fencing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While lawmakers were initially supportive of the fencing to secure the area, and the thousands of National Guard troops sent to the Capitol to back up the overwhelmed police force, they soon said they were ready for a drawdown. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I think we’ve overdone it,” said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky last month. “It looks terrible to have the beacon of our democracy surrounded by razor wire and National Guard troops.“ \u003c/p>\u003cp>Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, the top Republican on the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, said the fencing should come down because the next security problem is “highly unlikely to be a carbon copy of the last problem.” Republican Rep. Carlos Gimenez of Florida told Fox News he believed Democrats were keeping the fence up for “political reasons.\" \u003c/p>\u003cp>But abhorrence of the fence is a rare issue on which the two parties can agree. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s just ghastly, it’s an embarrassment,” said Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat. “If there’s a better way to protect us, I want to see it. I want to work to get it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Security officials, though, say that the Capitol cannot return to what had been status quo. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In February, acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman told lawmakers that “the Capitol’s security infrastructure must change.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>A \u003ca href=\"https://www.speaker.gov/sites/speaker.house.gov/files/20210315_Final_Report_Task_Force_1.6_Capitol_Security_Review_SHORT.pdf\">security review\u003c/a> requested by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in the aftermath of the riot and conducted by a task force recommended eventually replacing the barrier with mobile fencing and “an integrated, retractable fencing system” that could be used as needed. But it is unclear whether such an expensive proposal could win approval from Congress. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Ryan said his committee was doing extensive research and even had a recent call with Israeli security officials to learn how they keep their government secure. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’ve got to figure out what the sweet spot is with the security,” he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>This story has been corrected to reflect that Illinois Sen.
